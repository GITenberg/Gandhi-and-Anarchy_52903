<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The struggle for Indian Home Rule which
was started with the inauguration of the Indian
National Congress has many difficulties to
encounter, has strong and powerful opponents
and has received many checks. But its strongest
opponent is Mr. Gandhi and perhaps the most
severe check it has received is the adoption by
the National Congress at his instance in
Calcutta and Nagpur of the so-called-Non-violent
Non-co-operation. Non-co-operation as
advocated by Mr. Gandhi may be a weapon to
be used when constitutional methods have
failed to achieve our purpose. Non-violence and
passive suffering will lead to bloodshed or be
unfruitful of any satisfactory results. Moreover,
nothing shows the lack of statesmanship more
than practically basing the claim for Swaraj
upon the Punjab and the Khilafat grievances.
As representing Asia against Europe, the fair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">{x}</a></span>
against the white race, the Hindus regarded
the Turkish Empire with sympathy and were
disposed to support the Mahomadens as Asiatic
representatives. But when by Gandhi and
Khilafatist that claim was abandoned; when the
Arabs perhaps the noblest of the Mahomadan
races who fought as our allies and helped us to
defeat Turkey were sought to be brought under
Turkish dominion, when other Asiatic races
freed by the war were asked to accept Turkish
sovereignty on grounds based on the Mahomaden
religion which had already produced
such baneful result in India, the situation
became entirely different. It was rightly
realised by many, and the sequel has proved
that they were right, that the path of the
progress of the Gandhi movement fused with
the Khilafat element will be bloody. The claim
for Indian Home Rule rests upon very different
grounds. The Hindus have nothing to do with
the Khilafat agitation. The Mahomadans
themselves are not agreed as to the claims
advanced on behalf of the Calif. It is even
questionable, to put it mildly, whether that
claim has the support of the majority of the
Mahomadans. While the claim itself rested on
such slender grounds, the means first adopted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">{xi}</a></span>
to enforce the claim were grotesque. The
methods advocated by Mr. Gandhi and the
Congress are directed against Western civilization;
against the class which fought for and
won the reforms; and the Montague reforms
scheme of constitutional progress. They have
failed miserably and as was natural more
violent methods leading to direct conflict with
the forces of Government have been advocated
which would in all probability have been
carried out but for the arrest and imprisonment
of Mr. Gandhi. He belongs to a class of
thought which has attracted some of the noblest
minds in this world, but in applying his the
gospel of life to politics, he has shown himself
a babe and his interference has been generally
mischievous. In South Africa he is responsible
for creating a situation which makes a
peaceful and satisfactory solution practically
impossible. His factious policy in India stands
in the way of further reforms. The opposition
to Gandhi was however not strenuous. The
so-called Moderates only whispered their
protests against his policy so as not to be
heard beyond a few feet. They are loud
however, in their denunciation of Government
action to check the illegal activities of Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">{xii}</a></span>
Gandhi and his followers. It can hardly be
doubted that their cautious attitude has contributed
to the growth of the Gandhi movement.
But the inexplicable conduct of a certain&mdash;I
won't say class&mdash;body of gentlemen has still
more contributed to that result.</p>

<p>There is scarcely any item in the Gandhi
programme which is not a complete violation
of everything preached by the foremost sons
of India till 1919; which has not been strongly
even vehemently denounced by those old
respected members of the Congress who now
follow Mr. Gandhi, Pandit Malaviya, Messrs.
Vijayaragavachari, Lajapat Rai, Natarajam,
S. Kasturiranga Iyengar, the Editor of the
'Hindu.' Mr. Gandhi's emotional outbursts,
fastings, penances, Sanyasi waist cloth, may
carry away the emotional masses, women and
students. But whether this wave of emotionalism
submerged the men abovenamed I
would not care to guess. No one of course has
any right to find fault with his genuine
followers like Mr. Prakasam, Editor, 'Swaraj'
whose motives, however much we might differ
from his politics, no one will question. He is
one of those genuine patriots who believes in
the efficacy of Mr. Gandhi's methods to obtain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span>
Home Rule. By far the great majority
however, follow him for other reasons.</p>

<p>The severe simplicity and austerity of Mr.
Gandhi's life combined with his appeal to the
principle of '<i>Ahimsa</i>' non-injury inherited from
Buddists and now ingrained in Hindu life, has
secured him the support of the Hindu masses
and particularly vegetarians. His support of
the caste system has won over the higher
classes and the reactionary elements of Hindu
society to his side. The caste system is entirely
opposed to the 'Ahimsa' (Non-injury) principle.
The former has dedicated one of the main
castes to death. Its function is to kill and be
killed. It is also the function of some of the
sub-castes of the lowest caste or class to
slaughter animals. His indiscriminating support
of the extreme Khilafat demands has ensured
the Mahomedan support. Islam is more opposed
than the caste system to "Ahimsa." The
trouble with the Hindus over the slaughter of
cows is due to this difficulty. Some politicians
who naturally desire to use him and the influence
he has acquired for putting pressure on the
Government to concede further reform, also
have joined him. But I am satisfied he is using
them all to further his own ends. An attempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span>
in which he is bound to fail. His success <i>i.e.</i>
the success of the reactionary forces in India to
obtain what they call Dominion status or Home
Rule, but, which really means their rule, will
not only lead to bloodshed and anarchy and
the dismemberment of the Empire; but to the
triumph of a reactionary policy, social, moral
and economic, against which the democratic
policy of the recent reforms and the Legislative
Councils is an emphatic protest. I have
attempted in the following pages to give my
reasons for these conclusions.</p>

<p>Far more important than my narrative
are the extracts published in the appendix.
They consist of speeches made by the Viceroy,
and members of Government in the Legislative
Councils. I have on account of considerations
of space omitted speeches in many provinces.
I have not given any speech in full for the same
reason. I have also given a list of riots or
disturbances. These give a fair idea of the
activities of Mr. Gandhi.</p>

<h2>HIS PHILOSOPHY</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> of us are now striving for "Swaraj" or
Home Rule. We wish to be masters of our
own destiny. We want sooner or later the
representatives of the people of the country to
govern it. There are some amongst us who
consider that Home Rule, is an immediate
necessity. Others believe that Home Rule, at
present without the fulfilment of certain preliminary
conditions would be attended with disastrous
results. But all are agreed that we
should work for it. The practical difficulties
in the way of its attainment due, partly to the
relations between the various communities in
India, partly to the opposition of powerful
interests and the period that must therefore
elapse before we overcome them render the discussion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
of time, ignoring or brushing aside
those difficulties, only of academic interest. Mr.
Gandhi's great influence is due to the popular
belief in the efficacy of his leadership to attain
immediate Home Rule. To me his Non-Co-operation
Campaign appears to be an egregious
blunder for which we are already paying dearly.
A long line of illustrious statesmen, Indian and
English have just succeeded in leading us out of
the house of bondage. How long we shall have
to wander in the deserts we do not know. But it
is certain that Mr. Gandhi is not leading his
followers in the direction of the promised land.
He is not only going in the opposite direction
but instead of toughening our fibre by a life of
toil and struggle is endeavouring to entirely
emasculate us and render us altogether unfit
for the glorious destiny that, but for him and
others like him, is awaiting us.</p>

<p>This will be clear once the nature of his
agitation is realised. For that purpose, it is
necessary to understand his mentality and his
real views on the problems of life and the various
questions now in debate.</p>

<p>These are given in various books which
have been published and in his paper "Young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
India", edited by him. His "Indian Home
Rule", was first published in 1908. In a publication
of 1921, he says "I withdraw nothing
except one word of it and that in deference to
a lady friend." The reason is the indelicacy
of the expression....</p>

<p>The book is in the form of a dialogue between
a Reader and the "Editor" the latter
being Gandhi himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi wishes to know the necessity
of driving away the English,</p>

<div class="notequote">

 <p><i>Reader</i>:&mdash;"Because India has become impoverished
by their Government. They take away our money from
year to year. The most important posts are reserved
for themselves. We are kept in a state of slavery. They
behave insolently towards us, and disregard our feelings."</p>

 <p><i>Gandhi</i>:&mdash;"Supposing we get Self-government similar
to what the Canadians and South Africans have, will it
be good enough?"</p>

 <p><i>Reader</i>:&mdash;"That question also is useless. We may
get it when we have the same powers. We shall then
hoist our own flag. As is Japan so must India be. We
must own our navy, our army, and we must have our
own splendour. Then will India's voice ring throughout
the world."</p>

 <p><i>Gandhi</i>:&mdash;"You have well drawn the picture. In effect
it means this: that we want English Rule without the
Englishman. You want the tiger's nature but not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
 tiger; that is to say you would make India English and
when it becomes English, it will be called not Hindustan
but Englistan. <i>This is not the Swaraj that I want.</i>"</p>

</div>

<p>Nothing can be clearer. He does not want
the dominion status of Canada or South Africa
for India. He does not claim the independence
of Japan for India as he points out a few lines
below, "What you call swaraj is not truly
swaraj."</p>

<p>What is then the real "Swaraj" according
to Mr. Gandhi? He proceeds to develop his
views by illustrations.</p>

<p>He gives his views on the poverty of India.
He says Railways, Lawyers and Doctors have
impoverished the country, so much so that, if
we do not wake up in time, we shall be ruined.</p>

<p>About railways he says as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

 <p>"Man is so made by nature as to require him to
restrict his movements as far as his hands and feet will
take him. If we did not rush about from place to place
by means of railways and such other maddening conveniences,
much of the confusion that arises, would be
obviated. Our difficulties are of our own creation. God
set a limit to a man's locomotive ambition in the construction
of his body. Man immediately proceeded to
discover means of overriding the limit. God gifted man
with intellect that he might know his Maker. Man
abused it so that he might forget his Maker. I am so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
 constructed that I can only serve my immediate neighbours,
but in my conceit, I pretend to have discovered
that I must with my body serve every individual in the
Universe. In thus attempting the impossible, man
comes in contact with different religions and is utterly
confounded. According to this reasoning, it must be
apparent to you that railways are a most dangerous
institution. Man has gone further away from his Maker".</p>

</div>

<p>And he advises all his friends to go into the
interior of the country that has yet not been
polluted by the railways and live there in order
to be patriotic.</p>

<p>I shall not insult the intelligence of my reader
by attempting a defence of the railways which
have knit India together. I will only observe
that according to Mr. Gandhi, the construction
and use of railways for locomotion not possible
for man in his natural condition, is an abuse of
God's gift. And why? Because if he comes
into contact with different natures, with different
religions he might try to serve others than his
neighbour whom alone God intended him to
serve!!!</p>

<p>As to lawyers, he will have none of them;
without lawyers, courts could not have been
established or conducted and without them the
British could not hold India. He has yet to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
learn that there were courts both in pre-British
India and British India before lawyers. He
thinks the Hindu-Mahomedan quarrels have
often been due to the intervention of lawyers.
He wants all people to settle their own quarrels;
"men were less unmanly if they settled
their disputes either by fighting or by asking
their relatives to decide them. They became
more unmanly and cowardly when they resorted
to the Courts of Law. It is a sign of
savagery to settle disputes by fighting. It is
not the less so by asking a third party to
decide between you and me. The parties
alone know who is right and therefore they
ought to settle it". Such is his opinion of lawyers
and of Courts.</p>

<p>He is even more harsh on doctors. His opinion
is quoted below as any statement of it in
my own words might be regarded as travesty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"Let us consider; the business of a doctor is to take
care of the body, or, properly speaking, not even that.
Their business is really to rid the body of diseases
that may afflict. How do these diseases arise?
Surely by our negligence or indulgence. I overeat,
I have indigestion, I go to a doctor, he gives me
medicine. I am cured, I overeat again, and I take his
pills again. Had I not taken the pills in the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
instance, I would have suffered the punishment deserved
by me, and I would not have over-eaten again. The
doctor intervened and helped me to indulge myself.
My body thereby certainly felt more at ease, but my
mind became weakened. A continuance of a course
of medicine must, therefore, result in loss of a control
over the mind.</p>

<p>"I have indulged in vice, I contract a disease, a
doctor cures me, the odds are that I shall repeat the
vice. Had the doctor not intervened, nature would
have done its work, and I would have acquired mastery
over myself, would have been freed from vice, and
would have become happy.</p>

<p>"Hospitals are institutions for propagating sin.
Men take less care of their bodies, and immorality
increases".</p>

<p>He says therefore that a doctor should "give up
medicine, and understand that rather than mending
bodies, he should mend souls", and he must also
understand that "if, by not taking drugs, perchance the
patient dies, the world will not come to grief and he
will have been really useful to him".</p>

</div>

<p>There is no use in arguing with him and his
dupes on this subject after this. But his
views must be borne in mind when we come to
deal with the present agitation.</p>

<p>About education, his views are equally
remarkable. If, he says, education simply
means knowledge of letters it is merely an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
instrument and an instrument may be well used
or abused. He adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"We daily observe that many men abuse it and very
few make good use of it".</p>

</div>

<p>He will not give any education to a raiyat or
poor peasant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"The ordinary meaning of education is a knowledge
of letters. To teach boys reading, writing and arithmetic
is called primary education".</p>

<p>"What do you propose to do by giving him a knowledge
of letters? Will you add an inch to his happiness?
Do you wish to make him discontented with his cottage
or his lot?"</p>

</div>

<p>So much for primary education. As to higher
education he says he has learnt Geography,
Astronomy, Algebra, Geometry etc., but neither
has that learning benefited him nor any body
about him. As to knowledge of English, it is
only useful to enslave people:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"The foundation that Macaulay laid of education",
he says: "has enslaved us. It is worth noting that by
receiving English education, we have enslaved the nation.
Hypocrisy, tyranny etc. have increased; English-knowing
Indians have not hesitated to cheat and strike terror
into the people. Now, if we are doing anything for the
people at all, we are paying only a portion of the debt
due to them".</p>

</div>

<p>I shall have to deal with this question of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
education later in connection with this appeal
to the boys to leave the schools and colleges.</p>

<p>After all this, it will not surprise any one to
be told that we must have nothing to do with
machinery:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"It was not that we did not know how to invent
machinery, but our forefathers knew that, if we set our
hearts after such things, we would become slaves and
lose our moral fibre. They, therefore, after due deliberation,
decided that we should only do what we could
with our hands and feet. They saw that our real happiness
and health consisted in a proper use of our hands
and feet."</p>

</div>

<p>He would not therefore have mills for the
reason that machinery is the chief symbol of
modern civilisation and it has already begun to
desolate Europe. In his opinion it were better
for us to send money to Manchester and to use
flimsy Manchester cloth than to multiply
mills in India. I wonder why he does not
ask Lancashire to pay him his crore of rupees.
Lancashire would no doubt do so in consideration
of the monopoly of supplying
India with manufactured goods and India
would, according to Mr. Gandhi, get Swaraj.
India does not want manufactured goods; he
asks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
"What did India do before these articles were
introduced? Precisely the same should be done to-day.
As long as we cannot make pins without machinery, so
long will we do without them. The tinsel splendour of
glassware we will have nothing to do with, and we will
make wick, as of old, with home grown cotton, and use
hand-made earthen saucers for Lamps". He finally
adds: "I cannot recall a single good point in connection
with machinery."</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Gandhi wrote his book in 1908 after a
visit to England when the Liberal and the
Labour parties were carrying on their great
campaign in favour of the working men and
against the capitalists and Lloyd George was
about to launch his great land campaign. He
seems to have been impressed with the horrors
of the condition of the wage earners which
was then portrayed in dark colours in order to
support that campaign. His mind, emotional
and ill balanced, seems to have been entirely
upset by the descriptions that he had then
read. He is on the fringe of a large question
about which he seems to have been singularly
ill informed. In England there is not at this
time and there was not when he wrote, any
question of the destruction of machinery which
is a necessary adjunct to the industrial system.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
The questions under debate are the conditions
of labour and the distribution of the wealth
created by machinery between capitalists and
labour. These questions have been under consideration
now for some years; the condition of
the labourers is being slowly improved, a minimum
wage has been introduced and there is a
prospect of a still more equitable distribution of
the proceeds between capital and labour. Mr.
Gandhi says that he has read Dutt's book on
the decline of Indian industries but he
does not seem to have learnt the lesson inculcated
therein&mdash;that it is necessary to improve
our industries not only to meet the needs of
the people of the country, find employment for
our labouring population, but also not to
force them to compete with the cultivating
classes. In India the same problem
as in England awaits us. We have to
see that the condition of the labourers
in the mills and in the other industries
is improved. In asking for the ruin of
all our manufacturing industries Mr. Gandhi
is only playing into the hands of our opponents.
He will find strong support in this respect from
Lancashire who will, according to some Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
publicists, only be too willing to take any steps
to effect the destruction of our competing
industries. If he had directed half the energy
of his non-co-operation campaign to improving
the conditions of the workmen in all our industries
he might possibly have succeeded in
getting rid of many of those evils which in his
opinion require elimination of all machinery
and of all industrial undertakings. The other
reason for the deplorable condition of the industrial
workmen in England is the congestion and
overcrowding, in the industrial centres. This
is due to a great extent to the action of the
landlords who will not allow any expansion of
those industrial centres in order to increase the
value of their land and thus to exploit the
community. In India we have not got that
trouble. There is ample room for extension
except in Bombay, in all the industrial centres
and even in Bombay the difficulty is not due,
so far as I am informed to the action of landlords
but to natural conditions arising out of the
geography of Bombay. Machinery is essential
to the creation of wealth by manufacturing industries.
The evils that have been portrayed
by Mr. Gandhi can be and are being removed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
by patient effort. His tirade against machinery
and mill industries on account of the evils he
has witnessed in the West, is due to his ignorance;
a little knowledge in his case has proved
a dangerous thing. It is this feeling which has
led him to advocate the universal use of spinning
wheel in India. This might be useful as a
cottage or home industry. It might find work
for some who would otherwise be idle. But
he is living in a fool's paradise if he considers
it a substitute for or will supplant, machinery.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to say that he hates
Parliaments:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"The condition of England at present is pitiable. I
pray to God that India may never be in that plight.
That which you consider to be Mother of Parliaments is
like a sterile woman and a prostitute. Both these are
harsh terms, but exactly fit the case. That Parliament
has not yet of its own accord done a single good thing;
hence I have compared it to a sterile woman. The
natural condition of that Parliament is such that without
out-side pressure it can do nothing. It is like a prostitute
because it is under the control of ministers who
change from time to time. To-day it is under Mr.
Asquith; tomorrow it may be under Mr. Balfour."</p>

<p>"If the money and the time wasted by Parliament
were entrusted to a few good men, the English nation
would be occupying to-day a much higher platform.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
The Parliament is simply a costly toy of the nation.
These views are by no means peculiar to me. Some
great English thinkers have expressed them.</p>

<p>"That you cannot accept my views at once is only
right. If you will read the literature on this subject,
you will have some idea of it. The Parliament is
without a real master, under the Prime Minister, its
movement is not steady, but it is buffeted about like a
prostitute. The Prime Minister is more concerned about
his power than about the welfare of the Parliament. His
energy is concentrated upon securing the success of
his party. His care is not always that the Parliament
shall do right. Prime Ministers are known to have made
the Parliament do things merely for party advantage.
All this is worth thinking over."</p>

</div>

<p>It is no wonder that he called upon all his
followers to boycott the Indian Councils. I
shall deal with this when dealing with the boycott
question.</p>

<p>After all this one would naturally think that
if we expel the English from India we would
be happy. Not a bit, says Mr. Gandhi whose
views about independence are peculiar. Look,
he says, at Italy. He thinks that Italy has not
gained anything by independence of Austrian
domination. He adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"If you believe that because Italians hold Italy, the
Italian nation is happy, you are groping in darkness.
What substantial gain did Italy obtain after the withdrawal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
 of the Austrian troops? The gain is only nominal.
You do not want therefore to reproduce the same conditions
in India. India to gain her independence can
fight like Italy only when she has arms and in order to
gain her independence India has to be armed and to arm
India on a large scale is to Europeanise it. Then her
condition will be just as pitiable as that of Europe.
This means in short, that India must accept European
civilisation ... but the fact is that the Indian nation will
not adopt arms and it is well that she does not."</p>

</div>

<p>She must not therefore use force to fight the
English.</p>

<p>But what is it she has to do. She must
obtain Swaraj or Home Rule by 'soul force'.
What is it?:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"When we are slaves we think that the whole universe
is enslaved. Because we are in an abject condition, we
think that the whole of India is in that condition. As a
matter of fact, it is not so, but it is as well to impute
our slavery to the whole of India. But if we bear in mind
the above fact we can see that if we become free, India
is free. And in this thought you have definition of
'swaraj.' It is 'swaraj' when we earn to rule ourselves.
It is therefore in the palm of our hands. Do
not consider this 'swaraj' to be like a dream. Hence
there is no idea of sitting still. The 'swaraj' that
I wish to picture before you and me is such that, after
we have once realised it, we will endeavour to the end
of our lifetime to persuade others to do likewise. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
 such 'swaraj' has to be experienced by each one
for himself."</p>

</div>

<p>The assumption made by a few persons that
Mr. Gandhi is only condemning parliamentary
government for its inutility is unfounded.
The extracts already given might lend some
colour to that view. But such is not the fact.
In England Parliamentary government is
denounced by certain persons on the ground
that it will always be under the influence of
a capitalist Press and therefore unable to
redress the evils from which the people of the
country other than the capitalists are suffering.
Mr. Gandhi's objection is not based on any
such ground; he is against not only Parliamentary
Government but practically against
any Government in any form as is apparent
from the extracts given above. The doctrine
that Governments have very little to do with
our happiness which depends upon self-control
or 'soul force' has many advocates, but to
deduce it as a doctrine from the alleged failure
of Parliamentary Government in England is
ludicrous. I shall not stop here to justify
Parliamentary government which has justified
itself by its results; it is only ignorance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
work that has been done which is responsible
for opinions like those to which Mr. Gandhi
has given expression.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the book he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>Before I leave you, I will take the liberty of
repeating:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Real Home Rule is Self Rule or control;</p>

<p>2. The way to it is Passive Resistance; that is soul
force or love force.</p>

<p>In my opinion, we have used the term "Swaraj"
without understanding its real significance. I have
endeavoured to explain it as I understand it, and my
conscience testifies that <i>my life henceforth is dedicated
to its attainment</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Such is the real Gandhi. Railways, lawyers,
courts, doctors, education on Western
lines, machinery of every kind or manufacturing
industries, parliamentary government
should disappear. He is singularly ill informed
on every one of the questions he has discussed.
'Soul force' alone should be relied
upon. No resistance should be offered to violence.
No resistance should be offered to
robbery and the robbers are to be left to cut
one another's throats. No resistance to be
offered to murderers or to those who might
want to enslave you. Briefly, no protection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
is to be given by laws and their administrators
to person and property.</p>

<p>There is no harm perhaps as long as such
fantastic visionaries restrict the application
of these principles to themselves, to their
own persons or properties. But it becomes
a serious matter when their general application
is sought for.</p>

<p>These are the sentiments he expressed in
1908, and it was with these sentiments that he
came to India. As it is well to be definite and
clear, I will quote from a letter addressed by
him in 1909 to a friend in India:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"Bombay, Calcutta and the other chief cities of
India are the real plague spots".</p>

<p>"If British rule were replaced tomorrow by Indian
rule based on modern methods, India would be no better,
except that she would be able then to retain some of the
money that is drained away to England; but then India
would only become a second or fifth nation of Europe
or America".</p>

<p>"Medical science is the concentrated essence of black
magic. Quackery is infinitely preferable to what passes
for high medical skill".</p>

<p>"Hospitals are the instruments that the devil has
been using for his own purpose, in order to keep his hold
on his kingdom. They perpetuate vice, misery and
degradation and real slavery".</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
"India's salvation consists in unlearning what she has
learnt during the past fifty years. The railways,
telegraphs, hospitals, lawyers, doctors, and such like
have all to go, and so called upper classes have to
learn to live consciously and religiously and deliberately
the simple peasant life, knowing it to be a life giving
true happiness".</p>

</div>

<p>But he soon found that it was hopeless to
carry out his theories in the face of the determination
of the people of India to attain Home
Rule preached by the Indian National Congress
and the Indian politicians. He had accordingly
to put on a new garb. Therefore, in 1917, the
year of the famous declaration made by the
British Government about the progressive
realisation of self government, he found it
necessary, to obtain a hearing, to accept the
Home Rule programme. In his Presidential
address at the First Gujarat Political Conference
in 1917 he said that without going into
the merits of the scheme of reforms approved
by the Congress and the Muslim League he
will do all that is necessary to get it accepted
and enforced. Though the scheme itself is not
'swaraj', he admitted it was a great step towards
'swaraj'. At the same time he said that though he
is acting on the propriety of the current trend of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
thought it does not appear to him to be tending
altogether in the right direction as the 'swaraj'
put forward is one of Western type. Nevertheless
as India is being governed in accordance
with the Western system and without Parliament
we should be nowhere, he does not hesitate
to take part in the Parliamentary swaraj movement
and the programme that he sketched out
for himself may be described thus in his own
words written in 1921:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"But I would warn the reader against thinking that
I am to-day aiming at the Swaraj therein (spiritual
swaraj as described in his 'Indian Home Rule'), I know
that India is not ripe for it. It may seem an impertinence
to say so. But such is my conviction. I am
individually working for the self-rule pictured therein.
But to-day my corporate activity is undoubtedly devoted
to the attainment of Parliamentary Swaraj in accordance
with the wishes of the people of India. I am not aiming
at destroying railways or hospitals, though I would
certainly welcome their natural destruction. Neither
railways nor hospitals are a test of a high and pure
civilisation. At best they are a necessary evil. Neither
adds one inch to the moral stature of a nation. Nor am
I aiming at a permanent destruction of law courts, much
as I regard it as 'a consummation devoutly to be
wished for,' still less am I trying to destroy all machinery
and mills. It requires a higher simplicity and renunciation
than the people are to-day prepared for".</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
He also admitted that his acceptance of
Parliamentary Swaraj required some modification
of his theory of using violence or force. He
admitted that though there is no scope for
violence or force in spiritual swaraj, and military
training is intended only for those who do not
believe in it, he was prepared to accept the
view that the whole of India will never accept
Satyagraha. He added:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"Not to defend the weak is an entirely effeminate
idea, everywhere to be rejected. In order to protect our
innocent sister from the brutal designs of a man we
ought to offer ourselves a willing sacrifice and by the
force of Love conquer the brute in the man. But if we
have not attained that power, we would certainly use
up all our bodily strength in order to frustrate those
designs. The votaries of soul force and brute force are
both soldiers. The latter, bereft of his arms, acknowledges
defeat, the former does not know what defeat is".</p>

</div>

<p>It was a consequence of this acceptance of
Parliamentary Swaraj that he should try to
work the Montagu Chelmsford Council reforms.
Though these reforms may be inadequate yet
for one who accepts the goal of Parliamentary
Government it was his bounden duty to avail
himself of the available Parliamentary scheme
to carry out those reforms which were then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
possible and to take the necessary steps to
enlarge the scope of the scheme to carry out
the further reforms that might be needed.
Accordingly at the Amritsar Congress in
December 1919, he resolved to co-operate with
the country in working the Reform Scheme.</p>

<p>I have already pointed out that he entirely
disagreed with the system of Parliamentary
government and his acceptance was one of
necessity. At the earliest opportunity at the
special sessions of the Indian National Congress
held at Calcutta in September 1920 and at the
National Congress held at Nagpur in December
1920 he took steps to destroy the Montagu
Reform Scheme of Parliamentary Swaraj and
everything else to which he had given a reluctant
assent and to bring the country to adopt
his wild theories already stated by me and in
order to do so, he brought into prominence
forces entirely opposed to his own principles
which he proved himself unable to control
with disastrous consequences and had to resort
willingly or unwillingly to dishonest methods.</p>

<p>What was the reason for his throwing
overboard the Montagu Reform Scheme? The
following resolution which at his insistence was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
passed by the National Congress at Calcutta
and practically re-affirmed at Nagpur will
explain the situation as then developed.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></div>

<h2>THE NON-CO-OPERATION RESOLUTION</h2>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"In view of the fact that on the Khilafat question
both the Indian and Imperial Governments have signally
failed in their duty towards the Musalmans of India,
and the Prime Minister has deliberately broken his
pledged word given to them, and that it is the duty of
every non-Moslem Indian in every legitimate manner to
assist his Musalman brother in his attempt to remove the
religious calamity that has over taken him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And in view of the fact that in the matter of the
events of the April 1919 both the said Governments
have grossly neglected or failed to protect the innocent
people of the Punjab and punish officers guilty of
unsoldierly and barbarous behaviour towards them and
have exonerated Sir Michael O'Dwyer who proved
himself directly or indirectly responsible for the most
official crimes and callous to the sufferings of the people
placed under his administration, and that the debate in
the House of Lords betrayed a woeful lack of sympathy
with the people of India and showed virtual support
of the systematic terrorism and frightfulness adopted
in the Punjab and that the latest Viceregal pronouncement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
 is proof of entire absence of repentance in the
matters of the Khilafat and the Punjab.</p>

<p>"This Congress is of opinion that there can be
no contentment in India without redress of the
two afore-mentioned wrongs, and that the only effectual
means to vindicate national honour and to prevent a repetition
of similar wrongs in future is the establishment
of Swarajya. This Congress is further of opinion that
there is no course left open for the people of India but
to approve of and adopt the policy of progressive non-violent
non-co-operation until the said wrongs are righted
and Swarajya is established.</p>

<p>"And inasmuch as a beginning should be made by
the classes who have hitherto moulded and represented
opinion and inasmuch as Government consolidates its
power through titles and honours bestowed on the
people, through schools controlled by it, its law courts
and its legislative councils, and inasmuch as it is desirable
in the prosecution of the movement to take the
minimum risk and to call for the least sacrifice compatible
with the attainment of the desired object, this
Congress earnestly advises:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) surrender of titles and honorary offices and resignation
from nominated seats in local bodies;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) refusal to attend Government Levees, Durbars
and other official and semi-official functions held by
Government officials or in their honour;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) gradual withdrawal of children from Schools and
colleges owned, aided or controlled by Government and
in place of such schools and colleges in the establishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
of National Schools and Colleges in the various
Provinces;</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) gradual boycott of British Courts by lawyers
and litigants and establishment of private arbitration
courts by their aid for the settlement of private disputes;</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) refusal on the part of the military, clerical and
labouring classes to offer themselves as recruits for service
in Mesopotamia;</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) withdrawal by candidates of their candidature
for election to the Reformed Councils and refusal on the
part of the voters for any candidate who may despite
the Congress advice offer himself for election; and</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) the boycott of foreign goods.</p>

<p>"And inasmuch as non-co-operation has been conceived
of as a measure of discipline and self-sacrifice
without which no nation can make real progress, and
inasmuch as an opportunity should be given in the very
first stage of non-co-operation to every man, woman and
child, for such discipline and self-sacrifice, this Congress
advises adoption of Swadeshi in piece goods on a
vast scale, and inasmuch as the existing mills of India
with indigenous capital and control do not manufacture
sufficient yarn and sufficient cloth for the requirements
of the nation, and are not likely to do so for a long time
to come this Congress advises immediate stimulation of
further manufacture on a large scale by means of reviving
hand-spinning in every home and hand weaving on
the part of the millions of weavers who have abandoned
their ancient and honourable calling for want of encouragement."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
The Khilafat question first, the Punjab
wrongs next are given as the two grounds for
discarding the Reform Scheme and demanding
Swarajya or immediate Home Rule for the prevention
of similar wrongs in future. For the
attainment of such Swarajya or immediate
Home Rule a policy of what is called non-violent
non-co-operation is advocated and as a beginning
the people are advised to take certain steps
which are therein referred to. Though discarding
the Montagu Chelmsford Reform Scheme of
Home Rule by certain stages, Mr. Gandhi
says he is working for immediate Home Rule
in accordance with the Resolution, to me it
seems clear what he is really aiming at is not
Home Rule of any kind or form <i>i.e.</i> Parliamentary
Government with absolute powers,
but Swarajya or Home Rule, as he himself has
outlined it in his Indian Home Rule, the purport
of which I have briefly given above, <i>i.e.</i>
anarchy and soul force. I shall now attempt
to show that there were no adequate reasons to
discard the Reform Scheme of Home Rule for
a scheme of immediate Home Rule and that
the steps proposed to be taken are not calculated
to attain Home Rule of any kind or form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
but are steps intended for Gandhi Swarajya
which means anarchy or soul force.</p>

<p>In considering these questions the object of
this movement must not be lost sight of. In
Mr. Gandhi's own words "Non-co-operation
though a religious and strictly moral movement
deliberately aims at the overthrow of the
Government." Prima facie therefore all steps
taken in pursuance of this resolution are intended
for this purpose.</p>

<p>I propose first of all to take up the Khilafat
question which stands first in the Resolution.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></div>

<h2>THE KHILAFAT QUESTION</h2>

<p>With reference to this Khilafat agitation it
is important to bear this in mind. After the
armistice of 1918, there were two memorials
presented on behalf of Turkey by the Muslim
residents in England, one in January 1919 soon
after the armistice, which included the names
of His Highness the Aga Khan, Abbas Ali Baig,
Rt. Hon. Ameer Ali, Messrs: Yusaf Ali, H. K.
Kidwai etc.; and one at the end of the year in
December 1919, the signatories thereof included
such Mahomedans as the following: H. H. Aga
Khan, Rt. Hon. Ameer Ali, Hon. Mr. Bhurgi,
Mr. M. H. Kidwai. Both included many non-Mahomedans,
some of them of great influence
and position. They claimed for Turkey, Constantinople,
Thrace, Anatolia including Smyrna.
There was no claim for the countries occupied
by those who were not Turks.</p>

<p>The Indian Mahomedan claim went much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
further. By the deputation to the Viceroy towards
the end of that year and by the subsequent
deputation to the Prime Minister and
others the claim was advanced for the restoration
of Turkey to the pre-war state, giving
Home Rule if necessary to the Armenians or
the Arabs etc. under Turkish sovereignty. This
of course was an impossible demand. The
Arabs are entitled to as much consideration as
the Turks. Mahomad Ali and Shaukat Ali are
really responsible for this claim.</p>

<p>Another claim advocated in the Council of
State in India was to let Turkey have Anatolia
and Thrace; full independence be given to the
Arabs and the countries inhabited by them
without any control by any non-muslim power.
Whether the evacuation of Aden is included in
this, I am unable to say.</p>

<p>The Indian Mahomedan agitation has become
a danger to the State on account of the failure
of the Secretary of State and Government of
India to tell the Indian Mahomedans that they,
the Government have nothing to do with the
Khilafat question; that their responsibility is
confined to representing to the British cabinet
the feelings of the Indian Mahomedans, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
the ultimate decision will depend upon what is
good for the Empire as a whole.</p>

<p>But so far as Gandhi was concerned the
position is quite clear. He puts forward whichever
is the most extreme demand made by the
Khilafat party without any enquiry as to their
reasonableness. He relies upon a 'promise'
made by Lloyd George in favour of Turkey
about their home lands and Thrace discarding
at the same time the limitation contained in
the promise to the subject races that they will
not again be placed under Turkey. He relies
upon another statement made by Lloyd George
that after this, recruitment went up. The fact
is that the recruitment of non Mahomedans
also went up and both were due to Sir Michael
O'Dwyer. Though he now denies having insisted
upon the evacuation of Egypt by England
as a necessary condition of satisfaction of the
Khilafat claim, he insists upon the withdrawal
of the Indian troops. For what purpose he
does not explain nor does he say whether he
wants England to evacuate Egypt. He knows, I
presume, that Egypt has repudiated the Caliph's
authority. He was not apparently aware that
the Arabs will not recognize the supremacy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
any Turkish power. But this is no difficulty to
him. For if that turns out to be the case he
says the Arab Chief who held sway over
Mecca and Medina might become the Khalif.
That Syria is not under England did not
matter. He wants the non-co-operators to be
satisfied by England that she was not in any
way responsible for the French occupation or
retention of Syria, in which case he is willing
to excuse her. He fails to appreciate the
weight of what appears to be an insuperable
objection that the Turks and their Khalif do
not want any domination over Arabia but, as
they said in their deputation in January-February,
1919, after the armistice, only wanted
to be left alone with economic and political
independence in their own ethnological area.
Neither Mr. Gandhi nor the Khilafat advocates
show any realisation of this fact. With
a light heart they maintain that the question
is not Turkish but Mahomedan and therefore
Turkish opinion alone cannot decide the
question. Palestine, of course, according to
Mr. Gandhi, must be under Turkish sovereignty.
It is enough for him that the prophet
of Arabia has so willed it. The prophets of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
Israel or the founder of Christianity, Jewish or
Christian sentiments, are as nothing in the
balance. The real truth of course is that in
the case of the Khilafat agitation Mr. Gandhi
and some of its most active and prominent
leaders want to use the agitation to destroy the
Government and not to effect a real settlement
of the question. The most energetic of the
promoters of the movement were Mohomed
Ali and Shaukat Ali. They were active members
of the Muslim League advocating Mahomedan
interests in opposition to the Hindus
in the old days of the Bengal Partition agitation.
In their public speeches they emphasised
the identity of the interests of the Indian Mahomedans
with the interests of the Mahomedans
elsewhere in Tripoli and Algeria in preference
to those of the Hindus, though living under the
same Government with them. Since the
Balkan wars, however, on account of their
intense hatred towards the British Government
for their failure to assist their co-religionists
in the West, they found it politic to approach
the Hindus. Then followed the internment
of the brothers which naturally still more embittered
their feelings towards the Government.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
During the internment they did not cease to
preach sermons of virulence against the Government,
and even after their release they did
not cease their propaganda of hatred against
the British Government. The independence
of India&mdash;no doubt as a preliminary step towards
a subsequent Mahomedan domination
in India&mdash;was as much their object as the full
restoration of the Khilafat domination to its
pre-war condition. This was avowed by the
Ali Brothers themselves. Mr. Shaukat Ali said
in April 1920:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"We do not embark on this step without fully realising
what it means. It means a movement for absolute
independence."</p>

</div>

<p>In fact, to those who know them or who
have read the proceedings of their trial no
evidence of this kind is required.</p>

<p>At the Khilafat Conference in Karachi&mdash;of
which they were the guiding spirits&mdash;held on
the 9th of July 1921 the following resolution
calling upon the Mohomedan sepoys to desert
in the name of religion was passed:</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"The meeting clearly proclaims that it is in every way
religiously unlawful for a Mussalman at the present
movement to continue in the British Army or to induce
others to join the army, and it is the duty of all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
 Mussalmans in general and Ulemas in particular to see
that these religious commandments are brought home to
every Mussalman in the army and that if no settlement
is arrived at before Christmas regarding our campaign
an Indian republic will be declared at the Ahmedabad
sessions of the Congress."</p>

</div>

<p>The two brothers were tried and convicted
by the ordinary civil courts, and the judge
pointed out that however lawful and constitutional
the Khilafat committee may have been
in its origin, however permissible the agitation
carried on in its earlier stages, those who were
controlling it soon began to rely on dangerous
religious propaganda. About them he said:
"They had seen them in Court, heard their
statements in the Lower Court and their
speeches here, and they could have no doubt
that with the exception of accused No. Six (a
Hindu) they openly gloried in their hatred of
the Government of India and the British name.
They justified the above resolution by the
religious law of the Koran which they said the
Mussalmans are bound to follow even when
opposed to the law of the land. All the
Mohamedans in this case including Mohamad
Ali and Shaukat Ali maintained, 'first,
that their religion compels them to do certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
acts, secondly, that no law which restrains them
from doing those acts which their religion
compels them to do has any validity, and
thirdly, that in answer to a charge of breaking
the law of the land it is sufficient to raise
and prove the plea that the act which is
alleged to be an offence is one which is enjoyed
by their religion.'"</p>

<p>It is impossible to believe that Gandhi and
his adherents are not aware that this claim of
the Mahomedans to be judged only by the law of
the Koran, is a claim which is the <i>fons et
origo</i> of all Khilafat claims of whatever kind.
It is as well to be clear about this, for not only
does the acceptance of the claim mean the
death knell of the British Empire or Indo-British
commonwealth, whatever name we
may care to give to the great fraternity of
nations to which we belong, but specifically
as regards India it means a real denial of
Swaraj. For it involves Mahomedan rule and
Hindu subjection or Hindu Rule and Mahomedan
subjection. Let there be no mistake
about this, no camouflage. Whatever the
Hindus may mean by the Hindu Muslim entente,
and I believe they mean a true equality, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
whatever the more enlightened Mussalmans
may mean, Mohamad Ali, Shaukat Ali, and
those of their persuasion, mean a Mussalman
dominion pure and simple, though they are of
course clever enough to keep the cat in the
bag so long as the time for its emergence is yet
unripe. They protest, it need hardly be said,
that they are animated by no <i>arriere pensee</i>,
no sectarian spirit, only by the most loving
goodwill towards the Hindu brethren. But
there are some of us who are too experienced
to be caught by this mischievous and pernicious
chaff and must sound the warning to those less
experienced and more gullible. Considering
the high character of some of the men who
follow Gandhi, I can only believe that this
realization came to them so late that it was
difficult for them to withdraw.</p>

<p>As pointed out in the Karachi trial, these
movements at first appear innocuous, then
grow dangerous.</p>

<p>The Khilafat associations throughout the
country were intended to carry on the "non-violent
non-co-operation" campaign against
Government. The process of evolution from
ostensible non-violence at first to violence is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
so well described by Mr. Macpherson speaking,
in the Legislative Council that I have quoted
it (App. XVI). It applies to all organisations,
but with greater force to Khilafat for reasons
arising out of Islam which will be shortly
explained. There is no judicial description
of this development in Malabar, the most
notorious instance. I shall content myself,
therefore, with giving a summary of the judgment
convicting certain persons for a riot in
Malegaon in April, 1920. So early had lawlessness
in this form begun to show itself. It will
also explain the methods adopted.</p>

<p>A political movement began in Malegaon on
the 15th March 1920, when a "Khilafat Committee"
and a body of "volunteers" were
formed. The Committee's activities took the
shape of lectures and "wazas". The lectures
were political and the "wazas" are said to
have been religious sermons. In January, 1921,
Shaukat Ali visited the town and lectured on
the Khilafat movement. It was shortly after
this visit that political activity became intensified.</p>

<p>The two Mahomedan schools, the Beitulullum
and the Anjuman school, used to receive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
grants-in-aid from Government. Money was
raised to enable the two State-aided schools to
refuse the Government grant-in-aid in pursuance
of the non-co-operation movement, and
a few Hindus were members of the party. The
collections were to be made by means of a
"paisa" fund, an old idea. Every person
selling a "sari", that is all the weavers in
Malegaon, were required to pay a "paisa" or
quarter of an anna to the fund.</p>

<p>The system left practically no option to the
weavers who objected to pay the "paisa".
Objecting buyers were encountered by persecution.
The fund Committee called a public
meeting on the 27th February, at which it was
resolved that the buyers refusing to make the
collections as directed should be commercially
boycotted. The commercial boycott of the
recalcitrant buyers was enforced by picketing
their shops with volunteers and their business
was stopped. The former had appealed for
protection to the authorities by applications and
petitions, but so long as nothing actually illegal
was done these were powerless actively to interfere.</p>

<p>Meanwhile lectures and "wazas" were being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
continually held in the open spaces in the
town and excitement was running high. On
the reports made to him the District Magistrate
came to the conclusion that in a place
like Malegaon which is ill-lighted the
carrying of swords and cudgels at public
meetings at night by volunteers was likely
to lead to a breach of the peace. He therefore
issued a proclamation on the 30th
March prohibiting the practice. It was a
breach of the terms of this proclamation
and its enforcement by prosecutions which
was the immediate excuse for the riot.</p>

<p>But the local authorities had also tried to
allay the friction and excitement in other ways.
The Sub-Divisional Officer, had called a meeting
on the 13th March with a view to find a method
of collection of the Fund which might put an
end to the trouble about it and stop enforced
contributions. Collection boxes were recommended,
but nothing definite was agreed to by
the other side.</p>

<p>Some of the leaders were persuaded to issue
a manifesto which was signed by eleven persons.
This manifesto quotes Mr. Gandhi's
dictates to non-violence and exhorts the volunteers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
not to carry cudgels and recommends
that only peaceful methods should be used in
collecting the Funds.</p>

<p>It clearly had little effect. One of the men
who signed it, on the 4th April (it had been
issued on the 1st April) at a public meeting
apologized for it on his own and the other
signatories' behalf and they were pardoned for
having signed it. Meanwhile the boycotting
and picketing of the shops of the Anti-Fund
people was continued. On the 15th prosecutions
were instituted against 24 volunteers
for a breach of the District Magistrate's proclamation
of the 30th March. On the 24th
April, the day before the hearing of these cases,
a meeting was again called at night at which
a leading Mahomedan is reported to have used
the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They must not be afraid of Government
or of the police and that the volunteers would
see about the cases brought against them and
may God give the volunteers strength to
promote their religion." The next day April
25th twelve of these cases came on for hearing
before Mr. Thakar the Resident Magistrate.
They ended in the conviction of the 6 volunteers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
and their being fined Rs. 50 each with
the alternative of 4 weeks' simple imprisonment.
The fines were not paid.</p>

<p>On the result being known the mob that had
collected gave vent to their feelings by loud
cries of "Alla-ho-akbar," the war cry used by
the mob throughout the riot, assaulted all
the police to be found in the town of
Malegoan, burned a temple, killed the Sub-Inspector
of Police, not the only one killed and
threw his body into the fire and looted the
houses of all who were opposed to the Khilafat
movement, the owners themselves having fled
in the meantime.</p>

<p>This illustrates the 'non-violent' methods
followed by the Khilafat committees and volunteers.
I give another instance in full for
illustration Barabanki (App. XI) which shows
perhaps more forcibly the violent fanaticism
supporting the movement. More instances can
be easily given.</p>

<p>The development from an apparently peaceful
to a revolutionary attitude is strikingly
illustrated in the Khilafat agitation not only by
revolutionary activities but by open declaration.
The resolution of the Karachi Conference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
showed the Mahomedan intention to declare
independence and proclaim an Indian Republic
at the following Congress at Ahmedabad in
December 1921. A resolution for absolute independence
was actually passed in the Subjects
Committee of the Khilafat Conference at
Ahmedabad, but was not passed at the Conference
itself only because the President ruled
it out of order. But immediately after the
meeting formally closed, the motion was passed
by the members of the Conference at the instance
of the President of Muslim League
whose speech as President will amply repay
perusal (App. XVIII). He was in effect only
carrying out at the Khilafat Conference the
intention of the Karachi Conference of which
the Ali Brothers were the moving spirits. In
his speech he points out, what in effect is
apparent to all, that Islam is opposed to non-violence
and, as he said in the course of one
of his speeches, the Mussalmans accepted it on
the promise of Mr. Gandhi to secure Swaraj
within a year. It was a legitimate move therefore
to proclaim a rebellion. Another difference
in principle was pointed out which is productive
of frightful consequences and must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
alienate Hindus from Mahomedans. The Ali
Brothers had already said that if the Afghans
invaded India to wage a holy war the Indian
Mahomedans are not only bound to fight them
but also to fight the Hindus if they refuse to co-operate
with them. When therefore Gandhi
and his followers fraternised with the Khilafatists,
the latter had no doubt of their support
if eventually it came to rebellion. They
were confirmed in this by Gandhi's attitude
on the questions in issue between them
and the Hindus. He advises the latter
Hindus&mdash;to submit themselves to Mahomedan
dictation. He begs them not to insist on the
prohibition of the cow slaughter by Mahomedans
and to rely upon Mahomedan forbearance
to afford them relief in that direction. On the
other hand he advises the Hindus to refrain
from irritating the Mahomedans by insisting on
carrying their processions past the mosques on
their religious occasions. He advises them to
study Hindustani as against Hindi; in fact
complete submission to the Muslim feelings in
all matters in controversy between them. His
attitude towards the Mopla outrages shows the
extent of his surrender. His alliance with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
Khilafat movement has led to frightful results
in Malabar. Relying on the assurance of
Gandhi and his followers, of Hindu support for
the Khilafat movement, and supported by the
teaching that the Hindus may be treated as
foes on failure to support them in a holy war,
the Moplas when they rose against the British
Government were furious at the Hindu attitude
of loyalty to England. The result was, themselves,
armed and organised they took the
Hindus unawares and committed atrocities too
well known, to need recapitulation here&mdash;butchered
them and inflicted injuries on them far
worse than death.</p>

<p>For sheer brutality on women, I do not
remember anything in history to match the
Malabar rebellion. It broke out about the
20th of August. Even by the 6th of September
the results were dreadful. The Viceroy's
speech made on that date deserves careful
attention (App. I).</p>

<p>The atrocities committed more particularly
on women are so horrible and unmentionable
that I do not propose to refer to them in this
book. I have selected a few accounts out of
literally hundreds that might be selected from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
the English and vernacular papers (App. III).
One narrative is by Mrs. Besant. The
resolution passed at a meeting presided over
by the Zamorin Maharaja at which, many of
the leading Hindus in the District were present
enters a strong protest against the attempts
made by interested persons to minimize the
gravity of the occurrence (App. V). The moving
appeal signed by many ladies headed by the
senior Rani of Nilambur who belongs to one of
the wealthiest families and were rulers in
ancient days shows the nature of the atrocities
and the apprehensions still entertained after the
rebellion is quelled (App. IV). I do not think it
advisable to publish any more but I would
point out in addition to those mentioned in
these articles two other forms of torture
credibly reported as having been resorted to
in the case of men&mdash;flaying alive, and making
them dig their own graves before their slaughter.
It is now ascertained that the Mahomedans
had held frequent meetings in their
mosques and, had made all preparations for a
rising. Hence it was difficult for the Hindus
in these tracts to make any defence or escape.
The horrid tragedy continued for months.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
Thousands of Mahomedans killed, and wounded
by troops, thousands of Hindus butchered,
women subjected to shameful indignities,
thousands forcibly converted, persons flayed
alive, entire families burnt alive, women it is
said hundreds throwing themselves into wells
to avoid dishonour, violence and terrorism
threatening death standing in the way of reversion
to their own religion. This is what Malabar
in particular owes to the Khilafat agitation,
to Gandhi and his Hindu friends. The President
of the Indian Moslem League, following
the Ali injunction, justified the Mahomedan
atrocities as an act of war against the Hindus
and the Government. Gandhi too pleaded for
the Mahomedans. All this was too much even
for their dupes who have entered a spirited
protest (App. III). It is impossible after
all I have said above that there can be any
sympathy with the Khilafat agitation. The
future may be envisaged. Gandhi and his
dupes have led Khilafatists to understand that
the Hindus will stand by them in any contingency,
impliedly assuring them, as they believed
in Malabar, of support even in resistance
to British rule. This Islamic consciousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
which looks to a brotherhood beyond India and
beyond the Empire does not support the claim
for early concession of Home Rule, for Home
Rule means Home Rule within the Empire,
not outside it&mdash;the Home Rule enjoyed by the
self-governing constituents of the commonwealth.
The Empire, it will be reasonably
urged, cannot afford to place great power in
the hands of a party which would subordinate
the interests of the Empire and of India to the
interests of a large body outside the Empire
who actually stand in opposition to it. The
introduction of this religious element in this
manner is fatal to the well-being of the Empire,
and unless some other basis can be found for
the Hindu-Mahomedan entente, it must go.
The extent to which Mr. Gandhi is prepared
to go in support of the Khilafat claim is stated
in this extract:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"What will the Imperial Government do if France
were to attempt to deprive England of Dover and India
were secretly to help France or openly to show indifference
or hostility to England's struggle to retain Dover?
Can Indians be expected to sit idle when the Khilafat is
vivisected?"</p>

</div>

<p>It is one thing to ask the Empire or India
to go to war in favour of an oppressed class&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
to ask her to do it in the interests of co-religionists
of a community living outside the
Empire is very different.</p>

<p>What is the present position? I shall describe
it in the words of one of Mr. Gandhi's dupes,
a secretary of a District Congress Committee,
Mr. K. Madhavan Nair of Calicut, who
writes on January 4th as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>Now the position is this:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Hindus and Mohamedans have been waging a
common war with non-violence as the fundamental
creed. It has to be noted however, that there is a party
led by the Maulana that advocates violence for the
achievement of their object. Suppose to-morrow that
party takes to violence and the other remains non-violent,
what will be the fate of the non-violent party if
Maulana's views are pushed to their logical conclusion?
Is freedom worth having if in the attainment of it you
have to loot, murder and outrage your innocent neighbour
who does not agree with you or approve of your methods
and is Swaraj possible of achievement and the Khilafat
likely to be righted by such means? Maulana's views
make those who have absolutely no faith in violence to
think over these facts deeply and anxiously.</p>

</div>

<p>The Indian Non-Mahomedans, did not trouble
themselves about the Khilafat claims. Mr.
Gandhi and his followers took it up as an anti-British
movement to secure Mahomedan support
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
to his non-co-operation movement. Even that
non-Mahomedan sympathy with the Khilafat
movement, has vanished. That movement
acquired its strength on account of such unfortunate
statements that the Secretary of State
and the Government of India are in hearty
sympathy with the Moslim demands; statements
like those reported to have been made
by His Highness Aga Khan that Mr. Montagu
is doing as much as it is possible to support the
Mahomedan claim and Gandhi himself could
not have done more. I doubt whether any
influential newspaper or any publicist in
America, England or the continent support the
Khilafat claim as advanced by Indian Mahomedans
or by Gandhi. However, the reputed
sentiments of Mr. Montagu and the Government
of India have influenced even moderate
Mahomedans and Hindus to support them
against the cabinet in starting and supporting
an agitation, which has now assumed dangerous
proportions.</p>

<p>The Khilafat movement does not want, and
Mr. Gandhi is not for, any reasonable settlement
of the Mahomedan grievance or for
Home Rule. They wish to get rid of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
British Government. Such being the objective
naturally the Khilafat Indian agitators have
put forward demands which the Turks themselves
recognise as outside practical politics.
They have hampered the efforts of their
friends for a revision of the treaty of Sevres.
Everybody now realises that this attitude of
the Khilafat movement under the guidance of
Gandhi and Mahomed Ali stood in the way of
any reasonable settlement. It is a futile
endeavour of the Indian and British Governments
to satisfy Mr. Gandhi or the Khilafat
agitators led by the Ali brothers. Gandhi
and his followers have greatly encouraged the
growth of Indian Pan Islamism which will in
future be always opposed to other Religions
and civilizations. I can well understand the
adherent of large numbers of Mussulmans to the
idea of Pan-Islamism. It must naturally have
a fascination for devotees of Islam by reason
of the splendour of its promise that Mussulmans
the world over shall one day be united under
one flag, but we have to take the world as it is
and to take into the consideration the forces
actually at work in reconstruction. The world
has passed the stage of religious empires. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
has gone beyond the stage of religious crusades.
We are on the threshold of an era of a
brotherhood transcending religious differences,
transcending even national differences and of
which one of the dominant notes is a unity
of purpose in which religious differences of race
and customs are to be merged and harmonised.
Pan-Islamism or Pan-Christianity or Pan-Budhism&mdash;one
can hardly speak of Pan-Hinduism&mdash;belong
to the world that is dead and not to
the world that is living. They mean destruction,
proselytisation, the assertion of superiority
the world war was waged to destroy. This
also shows the dangerous foundation on which
the Gandhi movement rests. Home Rule or
Swaraj is claimed not as an end in itself but for
the purpose of righting the alleged wrongs
sustained by foreigners. We know Gandhi's
principles which I have set forth above.
Swaraj or political independence is not what he
really wants. It is not the Caliph grievances
that have led him to claim political independence.
He wants to destroy the British
Government, as a hater of all Governments.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Government towards the
people of the Punjab and the Punjab officials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
is stated in the Congress Resolution as the
second and the only other reason for this non-co-operation
campaign against the Government.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></div>

<h2>THE PUNJAB ATROCITIES</h2>

<p>No one feels for the Punjab more than I
do. I doubt whether anybody was in a position
to know more of it than I was. Even
now with all the enquiries made by the Hunter
Commission and by the Congress Sub-Committee
many deplorable incidents as bad as
any, worse perhaps, than any reported have
not been disclosed. At this distance of time
it is best that they should remain so. It is
with a full knowledge of this that I make the
following remarks.</p>

<p>The conditions now have entirely changed.
Before the Reforms under a Lieutenant-Governor,
a single individual, the atrocities in
the Punjab which we know only too well, could
be committed almost with impunity. Now
instead of one man the Government of the
Punjab consist not only of a Governor who no
doubt is an Englishman, but of an Executive
Council consisting of an Englishman and an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
Indian, who was a non official before appointment
to his seat in the Council and for all
practical purposes two Indian Ministers who
are also consulted in all important matters.
Though, therefore, a repetition of the old incidents
may be possible, it is unlikely. The
Government of India again, which then consisted
of only one Indian, now includes three Indian
members, a powerful contingent. Above
all, it will be remembered that it was necessary
to pass an Act of Indemnity to save the
delinquents from proceedings in civil and criminal
Courts. Such an Act of Indemnity
would scarcely be possible now, with a Legislative
Assembly consisting of a majority of elected
members under the new constitution. The
trouble in the Punjab arose out of the Rowlat
Act which is repealed. Many high handed proceedings
were taken under the Regulations of
1818 the provisions of which were applied for
purposes for which they were never intended.
The regulations are now repealed so far as the
matters are concerned. Many of these proceedings
were taken under the Defence of India
Act and they also have gone so that for the
future at any rate our position is very different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
from what it was in the past. In such circumstances
what is it that one would expect?
If it is an honest endeavour that is being made
to solve the difficulties which arose out of the
Punjab, one would expect a demand for any
further guarantees that may be necessary
against a repetition of such occurrences and
the punishment of those who have acted not
under an error of judgment and not in good
faith. But the demands now made are of a
very different kind. They do not seek for
further guarantees, at least none are formulated.</p>

<p>I realise that the eulogium passed by the
English Cabinet on Lord Chemsford and Sir
Michael O'Dwyer was an outrage on Indian
public opinion. I believe also that the
Government of India committed a great political
blunder in not publishing their proceedings,
punishing the subordinate officials in
accordance with the orders of the Cabinet. I
agree further that it was an egregious mistake
to pass the Indemnity Act when India was so
excited. The Government should have waited
for the result of the proceedings in Civil or
Criminal Courts, when they might have
pardoned those who acted in good faith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
reimbursing their expenses. But that is not
the question now. Mr. Gandhi and his party
want certain persons to be punished on the
strength of the report submitted by the
Congress Committee who made an <i>ex parte</i> enquiry
of their own without hearing the other
side. This is not right. Moreover every
where it is recognised that the security of the
subject, person and property, requires that the
punishment of the guilty should be in the
hands of the Courts and not within the
discretion of an Executive Council. If these
officers whose punishment is called for are
guilty it is the Courts that ought to punish
them, and I speak with knowledge when I say
that no steps open to them have yet been
taken by those who carry on the agitation to
vindicate justice. Is it possible, then, to
maintain that the Punjab question in any way
justifies the tremendous agitation that is being
carried on for the dismemberment of the
Empire. Besides how is it possible for any
reasonable man to say that this affords any
justification for not utilizing the Legislative
Councils to help the Punjab and to carry out
the reforms of which the country is urgently in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
need. Besides it must be remembered that
some of the Punjab political leaders have
failed in their duty. During the crisis they
refused to come forward to substantiate their
complaints of maladministration of Martial
Law, even of those matters within their personal
knowledge. They did not give a chance
to the Government of India to control the
Government of the Punjab or the administration
of Martial law. <i>The real truth, of course,
is that the Punjab grievances are only a
pretext for this agitation, by the violent section
headed by Mr. Gandhi. It is really not the
redress of the Punjab grievances or prevention
of the repetition of atrocities that is sought for,
so much as the expulsion of the British Government
from India.</i></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></div>

<h2>SWARAJ OR HOME RULE</h2>

<p>The Resolution says that on account of the
failure of Government to redress these grievances
we must have 'Swaraj.' It is important
to remember that long before these occurrences
Mr. Gandhi had come to the conclusion that
we must have Independence. It would accordingly
seem dishonest on his part to say that
these events led him to the demand for Swaraj
or Home Rule.</p>

<p>In his scheme of "Home Rule for India"
Mr. Gandhi said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"Now you will have seen that it is not necessary for
us to have as our goal the expulsion of the English. If
the English became Indianised we can accommodate
them. If they wish to remain in India along with their
civilisation, there is no room for them. It lies with us
to bring about such a state of things."</p>

</div>

<p>Then in reply to the question that it is
impossible that Englishmen should ever become
Indianised, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"To say that is equivalent to saying that the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
 have no humanity in them. And it is really beside the
point whether they become so or not. If we keep our
own house in order only those who are fit to live in it
will remain. Others will leave of their own accord."</p>

</div>

<p>It is something that he gives a loophole to
the Englishman to remain in India. To the
question that there may be chaos and anarchy
on account of the Hindu Mahomedan position
he states:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"I would prefer any day anarchy and chaos in India
to an armed peace brought about by the bayonet
between the Hindus and Musalmans."</p>

</div>

<p>When it was pointed out to him that the
dissensions amongst the Hindus themselves
may cause the same result he is not dismayed.
He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"We are not to assume that the English have changed
the nature of the Pindarries and the Bhils. It is
therefore better to suffer the Pindarri peril than that
some one else should protect us from it and thus render
us effeminate. I should prefer to be killed by the arrow
of the Bhil than to seek nominal protection."</p>

</div>

<p>When it was pointed out to him that for
Home Rule at this stage we have not got an
army for our own protection he said the other
day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"I am here to confess that we are fully able
to take charge of all military dispositions in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
 country and that we feel able to deal with all
foreign complications." The worst that may happen is
he continued that we may be blotted out from the face
of the earth for which he was prepared so long as he
can breathe the free atmosphere of India.</p>

</div>

<p>The following report is interesting; we give
it below from the "Daily Express."</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>Q:&mdash;Are you anxious to take over the whole control
of the army at once or would you make an exception of
that object?</p>

<p>A:&mdash;I think we are entirely ready to take up the whole
control of the Army which means practically disbanding
three fourths of it. I would keep just enough to police
India.</p>

<p>Q:&mdash;If the army were reduced to that extent, do you
not apprehend anything aggressive from the frontier
territories?</p>

<p>A:&mdash;No.</p>

<p>Q:&mdash;My information, derived from Military sources,
is that there are over half-a-million armed men on the
frontier.</p>

<p>A:&mdash;You are right, I agree.</p>

<p>Q:&mdash;These tribes have frequently attacked India
hitherto. Why do you think they will refrain from
doing so when India possesses Home Rule?</p>

<p>A:&mdash;In the first instance, the world's views have
changed and secondly the preparations that are now
made in Afghanistan are really in support of the
Khilafat. But when the Khilafat question is out of the
way, then the Afghan people will not have any design
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
 on India. The warrior tribes who live on loot and
plunder are given lakhs of rupees as subsidy. I would
also give them a little subsidy. When the Charka comes
into force in India, I would introduce the spinning wheel
among the Afghan tribes also and thus prevent them
from attacking the Indian territories. I feel that the
tribesmen are in their own way God-fearing people.</p>

</div>

<p>But for the fact that he is well known to be
a Saint and Mahatma, I would have had no
hesitation in saying that his last observations
about meeting the Afghans show him to be
either a fool or a knave.</p>

<p>He said on the 16th February 1921:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"There must be complete independence, if England's
policy is in conflict with the Moslim sentiment on the
Khilafat question or with the Indian sentiment in the
Punjab."</p>

</div>

<p>And in his recent speech at the congress
opposing the resolution for Independence it
was said that if the Punjab and Khilafat demands
are complied with, Independence is not
necessary. Well, he knows or ought to know
they are impossible demands. The implication
is plain and taken in conjunction with what has
been said above as to the Western civilisation
and the Indianisation of the English people,
the conclusion that he is really aiming at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
Independence is inevitable. To certain Boy
Scouts on the 23rd March he was quite plain.
He said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"No Indian could remain loyal in the accepted sense
to the Empire as it was at present represented and be
loyal to God at the same time. An Empire that could
be responsible for the terrorism of the martial law regime,
that would not repent of the wrong, that could enter
into secret treaties in breach of solemn obligations could
only be reckoned as a Godless Empire. Loyalty to such
an Empire was disloyalty to God".</p>

</div>

<p>These have to be borne in mind when we
consider the question of the Swaraj that he has
put forward. The Swaraj that he works for is
thus described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"Swaraj means full Dominion status. The scheme of
such swaraj shall be framed by representatives duly
elected in terms of the Congress constitution. That
means four anna franchise. Every Indian adult, male
or female, paying four annas and signing the Congress
creed will be entitled to be placed on the electoral list.
These would elect delegates who would frame Swaraj
constitution. This shall be given effect to without any
change by the British Parliament".</p>

</div>

<p>A more preposterous demand cannot be
imagined. He excludes all those who do not
belong to his Congress. Those who do not pay
annas four and sign the congress creed form the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
majority of the population. Again to ask the
British Parliament to accept the scheme framed
by his party however absurd, without examination
of the same is absolute nonsense. If Mr.
Gandhi and his party can frame a scheme of
Swaraj for the consideration of the rest of India,
have it discussed with others modified if necessary
after such discussion, it may be, and it ought
to be placed before the Government and Parliament.
But this is the last thing he will do,
for various reasons. Mr. Gandhi himself will
never do it because I doubt whether he has
any correct idea of the Dominion status and all
that it involves. Mr. Gandhi is not a student
but an impulsive fanatic indifferent to facts
but obsessed by phantasmagoria. He jumps
to what he calls conclusions but which have in
fact no premises. Again he will not see it
done because what he really desires is not an
honest settlement which will give India a
further instalment of Swaraj but as the
preceding extracts show what he wants is
really absolute independence according to his
professions but really anarchy or soul force. If
he were honest in his desire to secure Swaraj
he and his followers would not have boycotted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
the Councils but would have entered them to
take further steps towards its attainment.</p>

<p>I am therefore satisfied that Mr. Gandhi
does not aim at a fair settlement of the Punjab
difficulties. He does not want an equitable
peace satisfying the just claims of the Mahomedans.
He does not want Parliamentary
Swaraj or Home Rule. But for tactical purposes
he is putting them forward to destroy the
English Government, in order to attain his
object of a society outlined in his "Indian
Home Rule," some features of it I have set forth
above.&mdash;A society without Government, Railways,
Hospitals, Schools, Courts, etc. His
programme is therefore put forward to clear
the way to obtain his object. This Swaraj is
to be attained by, in the words of the Resolution,
non-violent non-co-operation with
Government. And among others the following
steps were recommended for adoption: (1)
Boycott of Government aided schools and
colleges and establishment of National schools
and colleges, (2) Boycott of British Courts by
Lawyers and Litigants (3) Boycott of Reformed
Councils (4) Boycott of Foreign goods and use
of spinning wheels. Out of these I shall naturally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
take up the question of the boycott of
Government and aided institutions and the
nature of education sought to be imparted by
Mr. Gandhi.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></div>

<h2>EDUCATION</h2>

<p>The system of Education which Mr. Gandhi
apparently wants to introduce has already
been tried in some parts of India. The results
of a teaching confined to Eastern classics and
vernaculars has already been apparent. It has
produced a mentality amongst Hindus and
Mahomedans which has divided them from one
another. It has separated still further the
Brahmins from non-Brahmins, the caste Hindus
from the noncaste Hindus. It has again produced
amongst those who have received that
education a vague longing for speculative
theories and a distaste for experiment and
research by which, theories may be tested. Of
course Mr. Gandhi does not know these results.
His speeches and writings do not show that he
ever cared to enquire into these questions. He
does not want education to be imparted to the
masses and Western education to be imparted
to anybody for the reason that it would make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
them discontented with their present lot in life,
<i>i.e.</i> in other words he wants each class to
remain in its present condition, the lower
castes, slaves of their masters&mdash;the higher
classes. This consequence follows from his
acceptance of the caste system. He says
"Varanashram (caste system) is inherent in
human nature and Hinduism has simply reduced
it to a science. It does attach by birth. A
man cannot change his Varna by choice. Prohibition
against intermarriage and interdining
is essential for a rapid evolution of the soul."
He would relegate those Hindus outside the
pale of caste, the panchamas or the so-called
degraded classes, by whatever name they are
called, to degradation for the service of the
higher castes. His writings or speeches do not
show any knowledge of Indian History and
having spent the main portion of his life in a
far-off country the evils of the system perhaps
never came to his knowledge. Otherwise he
would have learnt the following facts. It is
this caste system which has brought about the
conquest of India by the Mahomedans and the
Englishmen, both of whom were always supported
by the lower castes against the higher.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
It is responsible for the large conversions to
Christianity and Mahomedanism. It is responsible
for a degradation of humanity for which
no parallel can be found in slavery, ancient or
modern. It is responsible for a good deal of
Hindu-Mahomedan, Brahmin non-Brahmin
problem and stands in the way of our social,
economical and political progress. Yet Mr.
Gandhi supports the system, though he
advocates the removal of one or two blots
which hardly affect the main structure. He
enters on an elaborate disquisition on the
benefits and necessity of caste which will not
do credit to Macaulay's fourth form schoolboy.
He shows no knowledge of the vast literature
on the subject or of the main arguments against
it. He is supporting the caste system to secure
the support of the higher castes, without whose
financial support his agitation must collapse.
One of his own followers would have told him
that caste has killed all the arts and science
in this country. Sir P. C. Ray points
out in his history of Hindu chemistry:&mdash;"the
fear of losing caste was thus responsible
for the loss of the faculty of independent
enquiry and hence for the decline and decay of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
all the arts and sciences for which India was
once so famous." Of course he does not want
that education which is indispensable for those
who occupy the higher Government offices in
the country. He does not want that education
which is essential for the development of
Indian manufacturing industries and development
of mineral resources.</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi accordingly made his wicked
attempt to destroy the National Hindu University
of Benares and the Mahomedan University
of Aligarh. They combined Eastern and
Western learning. The attempt was happily
unsuccessful. Strong pressure was put upon
the students to leave the Schools and Colleges.
Looking to the final results as disclosed in the
Report of the Congress Secretary reviewing the
work of 1921, Government have reasons to
congratulate themselves. By far the majority
of the aided institutions in Bengal have been
recognised by the Educational Authorities to
be very inefficient and they have been attempting
either to disaffiliate them or reduce their
numbers to give more efficient instruction to
those who remain, as a good number of them
were institutions started for commercial purpose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
It is remarkable that the great majority
of the students who obeyed the Congress cause
belonged to these aided institutions. Those
who left the Government Schools and Colleges
with better discipline and more efficient teaching
were very few if any. I would refer the
reader for further information as to the results
of the education campaign to the speech of the
President of the Thana conference, a genuine
patriot who happens, however, to be one of
Gandhi's followers (App. VI).</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi asked all the boys to withdraw
now from the schools on the pretence that until
the Government punishes the Punjab offenders
in the manner advocated by him and satisfies
the claims of the Khilafatists we should no
longer associate with the Government, and we
can there-by hasten the advent of Swaraj. This
is a mere pretext. He advocated the substitution
of the national kind of education as outlined
by him in favour of the present system
of education long before there was any Punjab
or Khilafat questions. He advocated them
in 1908 in his book "The Indian Home Rule."
To say now that he advocated them on
account of those reasons is sheer hypocrisy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
The step will not hasten but might retard
Swaraj. Even if the Punjab wrongs are redressed
in the manner suggested and even if
the Khilafatists are satisfied and Parliamentary
Swaraj obtained, he will still be an advocate
of the abstention from English Schools in
favour of the system of national education as
above set forth.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></div>

<h2>VAKILS AND COURTS</h2>

<p>The same is the case about his propaganda
about the Vakils and the Courts. It never
had any chance of success. I shall not dwell
however upon this but would refer to Thana
President's speech to which in connection with
education attention has been already drawn
(App. VI). He now puts them forth ostensibly for
the purpose of compelling the Government to
redress the Punjab and other wrongs. As a
fact he advocated them long before that in
1908, as I have already pointed out above.
Here again it is sheer hypocrisy to say that
they are advocated not as an end in themselves
but as a means for the redress of the Punjab
and Khilafat wrongs. He dare not openly
advocate this as desirable in itself as he would
then be laughed at.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></div>

<h2>BOYCOTT OF COUNCILS</h2>

<p>The other step that he advocates is abstention
from the new councils. His followers generally
have not voted at the elections or have
stood for election. His reason given at the
Calcutta Congress in September 1920 when he
moved his resolution on non-co-operation is
this. "I now come to the burning topic <i>viz.</i>
the boycott of the councils. Sharpest difference
of opinion existed regarding this and if the
house was to divide on it, it must divide on
one <i>viz.</i> whether Swaraj has to be gained
through the councils or without the councils.
If we utterly distrust the British Government
and we know that they are to-day unrepentant
now can you believe that the councils will lead
to Swaraj and not tighten the British hold on
India"? I can only ask him to read the history
of the Parliamentary struggle for freedom
in England which will show how freedom is
won from reluctant monarchs and privileged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
classes. Even in India the subsequent history
of the Legislative councils has shown
that the Government is willing to meet
the councils half way and almost every
question taken up by the councils has been
advanced nearer solution. But I doubt whether
there is any use of arguing with Mr.
Gandhi. The real truth is as he has candidly
avowed in his "Indian Home Rule" that
Parliamentary Government is in itself bad
and India should not strive after it as it will
stand in the way of his spiritual Swaraj. I
need not argue this point so far as the followers
of Gandhi are concerned as they are heartily
sorry that they boycotted the councils. I refer
on this point also to the Thana Conference
President's speech (App. VII). They feel
ashamed of themselves the majority of
them desire the dissolution of the present
councils and a re-election so that they might
utilize these councils for more powerful
Parliaments. Perhaps I should add that
considering the undisciplined fanaticism of the
non-co-operator and his total ignorance of
development of political organization, it is
probably just as well that the councils were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
in their inception preserved from such a
calamitous invasion. The council and the
assembly have even in the short duration of
their existence, achieved good results which
are carrying us far and quietly on that true
road to Home Rule from which Mr. Gandhi
seeks to divert us. Had the Non-Co-operators
been members of these councils and
had they acted in their present temper, they
might well have wrecked the Reforms and
have set back the clock of India's progress
even more than they have done already. The
boycotting is therefore in all probability a
blessing though designed as a curse. Still the
fact remains that the Councils might have done
even more had Mr. Gandhi been endowed
with the wisdom to see that India's interests
would best be served by using the councils
and the assembly as levers to obtain further
freedom on sane, safe, and constitutional lines.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></div>

<h2>BOYCOTT OF FOREIGN GOODS</h2>

<p>There is not only no objection to the Charka
but it is very much to be commended. It is
very useful as a cottage or home industry and
will find an occupation to many who might
otherwise be idle. But it will not displace
foreign goods at least without the aid of mills
by foreign machinery.</p>

<p>All these with other minor ones are only
steps to be taken to carry out the policy of
non-violent non-co-operation for the attainment
of Swaraj and Mr. Gandhi asks every
body, in fact the people of India, to carry on
non-violent non-co-operation with the Government
so as ostensibly to attain Swaraj but
really I have no doubt as an end in itself.</p>

<p>I have already pointed out that non-violent
submission to suffering and the consequent
attainment of self-control over oneself which
he called Swaraj was the end which he had in
view. He found that there was no use in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
directly advocating it. He therefore puts it
forward as the chief instrument for obtaining
the Parliamentary Swaraj which the people of
India wanted. He based his appeal to the
Hindus on the well known doctrine of "Ahimsa".
I will not stop here to discuss how far suffering
for the purpose of inducing another to
follow a particular line of conduct is included
in the scope of Ahimsa. I myself believe it is
not only not so included but is totally
inconsistent with it. I will merely point out
that this principle has already been condemned
by the Penal Code which makes it a crime for
a creditor to realise his debt by Dharna. For
my purpose it is only necessary to say that this
principle of non-violence if accepted in practice
generally will lead to chaos and anarchy. If
applied to Government alone by refusal to
recognise the jurisdiction of the courts it will
lead to the same results. How it will lead to
'Parliamentary Swaraj' it is impossible to see.
Mr. Gandhi says if all the people of India
adopted it the machinery of Government is
bound to come to a standstill. But that all
will adopt it without leaving sufficient men
with the aid of those who will be imported
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
from England and elsewhere to carry out the
administration is only the fantasy of a diseased
imagination. Non-violence is a guarantee on
the part of those who carry it out that the
Government has nothing to fear from physical
force. If they use force then they abandon
the weapon of non-violence. Mr. Gandhi and
his followers, are agreed that physical force is
now out of the question on ground, according
to Mr. Gandhi, that we will be crushed. I cannot
help thinking that when we take this aspect
of the matter along with others already mentioned
that Mr. Gandhi himself does not consider
this as any effective step towards the
attainment of the 'Parliamentary Swaraj,' but
only to attain his "Spiritual Swaraj." This
explains what he is so fond of reiterating that
when Lajpatrai, Motilal Nehru, and C. R. Das
and others were arrested and went to Jail without
complaint, or resistance denying the jurisdiction
of the courts, in pursuance of the policy of
non-violent non-co-operation, though Parliamentary
Swaraj was not attained, the spiritual
'Swaraj' of which he was in search has been
attained to his intense satisfaction. If he had
advocated abstention from schools, boycott of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
Councils and Courts, non-violence as a means of
attaining his (spiritual) Swaraj, giving up Punjab
Khilafat and Parliamentary Home Rule, no one
would perhaps have any right to complain,
and it would have been a straightforward and
honest course. But he has adopted underhand
methods which appear to me, unless a satisfactory
explanation is given, little short of
dishonest and fraudulent.</p>

<p>But it may be asked whether anybody would
have accepted a policy of non-violent non-co-operation
in the circumstances of the case unless
there was some reasonable prospect of
success within any measurable time. Here we
come to the most sinister aspect of the matter.
In moving his resolution on non-co-operation
in the National Congress held at Calcutta in
September 1920, he said, "If there is sufficient
response to my scheme I make bold to reiterate
my statement that you can gain Swarajya in
the course of an year" and he laid down certain
conditions, the more important of which have
been mentioned. That period has been extended
subsequently by a few months. Even that
extended period has elapsed. When charged
with his failure to attain Parliamentary Swaraj
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
within the period asked for by him he had
effrontery to state that the conditions mentioned
by him have not been complied with. A
political leader has no right to put forward
before the country any scheme under conditions
which he has no reasonable belief of being
likely to be complied with. Did he honestly
believe that those conditions named by him
would be complied with and Parliamentary
Swaraj obtained within the time mentioned by
him? Looking to the nature of the conditions
I do not think he believed that they would be
complied with, not only in one year but at any
time; and even if complied with I have no
doubt he did not believe that Swaraj would
come though he might assert the contrary. He
put the lure forward simply for the purpose of
persuading the Congress to make an important
change in the policy which the country had
hitherto adopted. The National Congress, carried
away by its hostility towards Government,
accepted his programme. Some of the younger
men may have believed in it. The older and the
most experienced I have no doubt never believed
in its possibility but considered it a means, of
rousing the people of the country from their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
political lethargy, to put pressure on the Government
for further and more extensive reforms.
They may also have felt that this
might be a means of Mahomedan co-operation
for their policy. I do not deny that according
to English political life this is a perfectly legitimate
manoeuvre though none of those leaders
believed in the soundness of the policy put
forward by Mr. Gandhi and many of them
said so.</p>

<p>Having attained his purpose by a representation,
the truth of which I cannot help
thinking he did not believe, and could not have
believed, and having committed the Congress
to a certain course of action, he is now able to
carry the Congress with him for revolutionary
action, as it finds it has gone too far on this
course to revert to its own natural methods of
progress. But as a matter of fact he went
further than this.</p>

<p>On 29th December, 1920, <i>i.e.</i> three months
after the change of programme, he said, "my
experience during the last months fills me with
the hope that within the nine months that
remain of the year in which I have expected
Swaraj for India we shall redress the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
wrongs and we shall see Swaraj (Parliamentary)
established in accordance with the wishes
of the people of India." But I do not think
for a moment he believed what he said. He
used these words to dupe the people of India to
follow him yet a step further and to pay him
money. After about a month on the 21st of
January 1921&mdash;he again confirmed his previous
statement. He said: "Four months of
this one year have already gone by and my
faith has never burnt as brightly as it burns tonight
as I am talking to the young men of
Bengal." And he added "that in case of his
death before the expiry of eight months he is
satisfied that the people of India will secure
Swaraj before the year is out." Is this not a definite
statement that the Indian people are
going to get Swaraj? A few days later the
purpose comes out. In a public address to the
merchants of Calcutta on the 30th January,
1921, he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"What I purposed to do I can accomplish in a
certain line. I Must attain Swaraj. If thirty crores of
people say that they are not with me yet I shall do my
work and win Swaraj.... If you wish to accomplish work
of thirty crores of men then come out with your money.
Try to have money and ask me to give an account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
 the same. I appoint some one treasurer.... If you know
that you yourself can not attain Swaraj <b>then help one
with money</b>. If you do not help with money Swaraj
will be difficult but not impossible to attain. If the
students of India do not help, me it does not matter.
If the pleaders do not help, it does not matter."</p>

</div>

<p>The old conditions of the boycott of schools
and of the courts as conditions indispensable
for the attainment of Swaraj are dropped.
And he promises Swaraj and asks for money
for getting it in nine months. He collected
money on the faith of that representation.
Earlier on the same day he got ten thousand
rupees, and on the spot a large sum is said to
have been collected. On the same date in
addressing the students he said: "If the
response continues as it has begun there is no
doubt of Swaraj coming within the time prescribed".
On the 23rd February 1921 he again
said: "Last five months experience has confirmed
me in the opinion. I am convinced that
the country has never been so ready for
establishing Swaraj as now." To me only
one conclusion is possible that he was collecting
the money from the people who understood
him to say that Swaraj will be attained within
the period mentioned by him. In March he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
"The last Congress has given a constitution whose
working in itself calculated to lead to Swaraj. It is
intended to secure in every part of India representative
committees working in conjunction with, and under
willing and voluntary submission to a central organisation&mdash;The
all India Congress Committee. It establishes
an adult suffrage open to men and women subject only
to two qualifications signing of the creed and a nominal
payment of four annas. It is intended to secure due
representation of the parties and communities, if then,
it is honestly worked, and commands confidence and
respect, it can oust the present Government without
the slightest difficulty. For, the latter has no power
except through the co-operation willing or forced, of the
people. The force it exercises is almost through our
own people. One lac of Europeans, without our help,
can only hold less than one seventh of our villages each
and it would be difficult for a man even when physically
present, to impose his will on, say four hundred men
and women&mdash;the average population of Indian village."</p>

</div>

<p>He said that we have therefore to concentrate
our attention up to the 30th of June on
getting:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) One crore of rupees for Tilak Swaraj Fund.</p>

<p>(2) One crore members on the Congress
register.</p>

<p>(3) The spinning wheel introduced in twenty
lacs of homes.</p>

<p>He added, however:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
"This programme does not mean cessation of the
other activities of Non-co-operation. They go on. Drink
and untouchability must vanish. The education movement
is steadily going forward. The National institutions
that have sprung up will, if they are efficiently
managed make headway and attract students who are
still hesitating. The pleaders, always a cautious and
calculating class by training, will, as they see the movement
progressing more and more, fall in line with the
rest of the country. Boycott of law courts by the
public is making fair progress. These things do not
now require concentration of universal effort. They
apply to special classes. But the three things mentioned
by me are the most essential: they must be done now
and without them the movement, as a mass movement
must be pronounced a failure." <i>"Young India" 30th
March.</i></p>

</div>

<p>After this it is impossible to rely upon boycott
of schools &amp;c. as conditions for Swaraj
within a year. It is now admitted and the
Secretaries report that the money demanded
has been collected. Such money was paid on
the fraudulent representation of Swaraj within
the year. Judged by ordinary standards Mr.
Gandhi's whole procedure with the promises,
the persuasions, the evasions, the subterfuges
and all the other man&oelig;uvres, would be
characterised by men of the world and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
of sane judgment in language, I hesitate
to reproduce, for the simple reason that I
believe that Mr. Gandhi is honest in his self
hypnotisation. I believe he does not really
know what he is doing. At least this is the
only possible charitable assumption when we
watch his feats of political acrobatics which
have the power of deluding such vast numbers
of people making them passionately intolerant,
violently intolerant often, of the slightest
criticism of their hero.</p>

<p>When the Congress was asked in September
to change its policy, Mr. Gandhi's idea to
start an organisation to supercede the existing
Government was not brought before them.
It is the first direct step in the path of revolution.
His followers have been by this time
brought to a proper frame of mind. The
use of the money to be collected was, as
stated on the 13th April, to be as follows;
"The only activity involving financial obligations
is that of spinning, organising national
service, in some cases supporting lawyers,
who might have suspended practice and cannot
be included in the national service as for
supporting national educational institutions."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
It will now be understood why some lawyers
were willing to suspend practice. Before the
expiry of one year period however other
conditions were imposed which would put off
Swaraj practically for a very long time to
come, the removal of untouchability of the
lower classes in India without which it was
said Swaraj would be a meaningless term.
This means, as I have no doubt, Mr. Gandhi
knew, he was putting off Swaraj indefinitely.
If this had been mentioned as condition when
the Congress was asked to change its policy
it is very doubtful whether he would have
got the Congress to agree with him. As to
these two conditions themselves they are
admirable. With a little tact the Government
might turn the tables on Mr. Gandhi. If
proof of untouchability consists only in the
admission of the boys of these classes to
schools of higher classes, it does not mean
much, though it is a notable advance. If a
contact with a low class person is placed on the
same footing as contact with caste man it
may be said that we have got rid of untouchability.
But this will not come throughout
the greater portion of India for years. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
these questions the education of Mr. Gandhi
has only commenced. He will find that without
abrogating the ceremonial law on which the
caste system rests there will be no practical
reform. He is apparently not aware of the
far more heinous custom of distance pollution,
<i>i.e.</i> not only pollution by touch but by approach
within a certain distance. This far from
being a move against Government would
support the Government contention against
reform.</p>

<p>About temperance also the move is salutary.
If the system of picketing adopted
by the volunteers is abandoned and peaceful
persuasion alone is attempted no one has any
right to complain. What all this has to do
with Parliamentary Swaraj or Home Rule
one finds it difficult to understand. But they
are necessary for the 'Gandhi Swaraj' advocated
in his 'Indian Home Rule', and I have
little doubt that like his other proposals they
were intended to attain that object.</p>

<p>It is admitted in the Report of the
Secretaries that the crore of Rupees which
was required to be collected, as stated above,
has been realised. About the middle of July
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
he said he still looked forward before the next
meeting of the Congress for the satisfaction
of his demands about the Punjab and the Khilafat
and full immediate Swaraj in accordance
with the wishes of her chosen representatives.
August and September were devoted to the
campaign of burning foreign cloth which in
his view was an act of non-violent non-co-operation
with the Government. This step
appeared unintelligible and inaccurate to his
followers who believed bona fide that he was
striving for political control. But it is quite
consistent with and in pursuance of his scheme
of spiritual swaraj of sacrifice and self-control.
On the 27th of October Mr. Gandhi speaks
of his "threat to seek the shelter of the
Himalayas should violence become universal
in India, and should it not have engulfed me."</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>As <i>New India</i> points out: "that would be interesting
to know when this threat was made. We all know that
Mr. Gandhi said that if there was violence he would go
to the Himalayas. There was a riot, but he did not go,
but excused himself by saying that if it occurred a
second time, he would go. A second riot occurred; he
said nothing but did not go. Now we hear that he had
made a threat to go, should it become universal in
India. When and where was this said?"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
Towards the end of the month the <i>Times of
India</i> observed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"Writing in the latest issue of Navajivan, his Gujarati
newspaper, Mr. Gandhi makes the interesting announcement
that if Swaraj is not obtained by December, he
will either die of a broken heart or retire from public
life, leaving the heedless people of India to their
resources. Were so clear a pronouncement by any
other politician, we could say definitely that when the
new year dawns Mr. Gandhi will no longer be actively
engaged in politics!"</p>

</div>

<p>Can there be any possible doubt that all
these statements were made by him in order to
impress upon his dupes the fact that they were
going to get Swaraj within a year and to deceive
his followers to follow him and finance him.
Yet what was the situation! Almost every
item in his programme has been tried and
found useless to attain Home Rule. I would
again draw attention to the speech of the
President of the Thana District conference
for a review of the situation as it then stood
in the opinion of one of his prominent followers,
(App. VI). This is the opinion of most
of his prominent supporters who have been
opposing Mr. Gandhi's programme from the
very beginning and accordingly the programme
was practically shelved and at the Congress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
held at the end of the year it was resolved
to suspend all the activities of the Congress
on which stress was much laid. The
programme of the volunteer organisation
throughout the country was to be carried
out on a more extensive scale and the laws
of the country were to be defied by disobeying
the notifications issued by Government.
The Congress also recommended civil disobedience
as the only civilised and effective
substitute for an armed rebellion and recommended
individual disobedience as well as
mass civil disobedience when the mass of the
people have been sufficiently trained in the
practice of non-violence. And the activities of
the Congress were to be suspended for that
purpose (App. XX). "Offensive civil disobedience
herein recommended is thus defined.
<i>Offensive civil disobedience means deliberate
and wilful breach of State made non-moral
laws&mdash;that is, laws the breach of which does
not involve moral turpitude&mdash;not for the purpose
of securing the repeal of, or relief from
hardships arising from obedience to such laws,
but for the purpose of diminishing the authority
of, or overthrowing, the State."</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
What took place at the Congress itself was
remarkable. The President of the Moslem
League, Moulana Hajrat Mohini, who was also
a member of the National Congress, proposed
his resolution for complete independence. He
is reported to have said that although last year
they have been promised Swaraj, the redress of
the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs within a
year, they had so far achieved nothing (App.
XVIII for his view). Mr. Gandhi denied that
there was any limitation of one year when the
creed was accepted in Nagpur and Calcutta.
The special representative of the Congress
organ, the <i>Bombay Chronicle</i> says: "The feeling
in general appear to be in favour of Moulana
Hajrat Mohini's resolution" though it was not
carried on account of the passionate appeal of
Mahatma Gandhi against it. It is instructive
to read the resolutions (Appendix XX)
that were then passed. Thus Swaraj was to
come on September 1-1921, October 31-1921,
December 13-1921. At the Congress in December,
1921, Mr. Gandhi gave up fixing any date
for the attainment of Swaraj.</p>

<p>The resolution passed in September, 1920,
was seditious. The resolution passed in December,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
1921, is openly revolutionary, and in
fact Gandhi made no secret of it. He
says: "Lord Reading must clearly understand
that the non-co-operators are at war with the
Government. They have declared rebellion
against it in as much as it has committed a
breach of faith with the Mussalmans. It
has humiliated the Punjab and insists upon
imposing its will upon the people and refuses
to repair the breach and repent for the
wrong done in the Punjab" (<i>Young India</i>).
Mr. Gandhi also said: "The Government
want to goad us into violence or abject
surrender. We must do neither. We must
retort by such civil disobedience as would
compel shooting." The volunteer organizations
were pledged to act accordingly. Yet when
the Government notified those illegal associations
and punished those who defied them, the
rebels indignantly remonstrate against what
they call coercion and interference with the
liberty of person and security of property.
They want to be in the limelight to evoke the
admiration of America and Europe for their
patriotism in rebelling against a Satanic
Government. But they are wanting in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
redeeming features of these rebels elsewhere&mdash;their
contempt of danger and death. That
is left here to the ignorant masses&mdash;the dupes
of these men who seek to protect themselves
from danger by their doctrine of non-violence.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></div>

<h2>NON-VIOLENT NON-CO-OPERATION</h2>

<p>How on earth is it possible to imagine that
all activities would be non-violent when those
who are carrying them on proclaim themselves
rebels against constitutional authority and are
bent upon destroying it; when they say that
they must commit civil disobedience of a
character that would compel the officials to
shoot them! when we know that one large
section of it, the Mahomedans, follow a militant
religion which not only sanctions but
requires them to use force to vindicate what
they consider to be their religious law. When
we consider further the nature of the activities
of those who carry on the Non-co-operation
movement there can be still less room to doubt
that riots ending in bloodshed are bound to
follow. In order to carry out the Non-co-operation
campaign India is divided into
various Congress provinces. Congress committees
are formed consisting of members who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
are also pledged to carry out the Congress
principles: there are also volunteer organizations
formed. The function of these bodies is to
impress upon the people of the country the
enormity of Government's crime with reference
to the Punjab and the Khilafat and the consequent
necessity of Home Rule or Swaraj. For
attaining such Swaraj they advocate progressive
non-co-operation by "peaceful" methods.
Such methods consist of various steps which
are described in the speech of Mr. Macpherson,
extracted below. Starting, perhaps, peacefully
they soon exhibit a tendency to violence
and when Mahomedan sentiments are involved,
when appeals are made to Mahomedan religious
feelings, that tendency becomes almost
irresistible in their case. Opposition to
constituted authority inflames them into violence
and instead of submitting to violence at the
hands of authorities according to the dictates
of Gandhi&mdash;a counsel of perfection&mdash;they
retort&mdash;and murder is the result. The process
is so well put by Mr. Macpherson in the Behar
Legislative Council that I take the liberty of
quoting the following extract from his speech:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"It is necessary to consider what is the essence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
the non-co-operation movement, what are its ultimate
objects and what are its methods. From the moment
Mr. Gandhi first unfolded his plan of campaign&mdash;that
was, I think, at a Benares or Allahabad Conference
in 1920&mdash;there has never been any doubt in my mind
that the objects of the movement were entirely
unconstitutional, that its methods were illegal and that
its prosecution to the bitter end is bound to result in
violence, disorder and anarchy, however much non-violence
may be proclaimed as the watchword of its
leaders. The movement cannot be judged by its earlier
and comparatively innocuous stages, as if these stood
by themselves. I refer to the resignation of titles, the
boycott of Government schools and colleges, the
abandonment of their profession by legal practitioners
and other such manifestations of non-co-operation,
although all these items in the programme have done
an infinite amount of harm, especially to the youth of
the country, and even these earlier stages have been
marked by repeated outbursts of violence, by a concerted
system of intimidation and social boycott, and by
the excitement of racial hatred which has had deplorable
results in individual cases. No, the plan of campaign
must be taken as a whole, and judged by its closing
stages, the enforcement of civil disobedience towards
the laws of the country, interference with the police
and the judicial administration, the invasion of police
stations, picketing of Courts, the seduction of the
troops from their allegiance, and the refusal to pay
taxes or rent or revenue. The movement must indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
 be judged by its ultimate object, which is the paralysis
and subversion of the existing Government and by
its inevitable result, general disorder and bloodshed
and widespread misery amongst all classes and communities.
If pursued to the bitter end, it will assuredly
have this result, whether it succeeds or fails, and should
it (which God forbid) succeed, the end can only be a
state of chaos which will make India the prey of the
violent tribes that dwell around her borders or the
hungry hordes of Central Asia who, in the course of
history, have more than once invaded India. <i>The object
of the movement being what it is, the overthrow of the
existing Government in India, what is the use of telling
us that either its leaders or its followers have signed a
pledge of non-violence? The pledge is a farce, it has
already been broken a hundred times over, and the longer
the movement continues and the further it advances, the
more it will be broken.</i>"</p>

</div>

<p>That this has been the case is illustrated by
almost all the riots which have taken place.
Malabar stands first in its unenviable notoriety.
There the Congress committees were formed;
the Khilafat committees also were formed;
Gandhi and Shaukat Ali visited Malabar,
preached their sermons and the usual result
followed. With Mahomedans Swaraj was only
their secondary aim, their principal object
being the redress of the Khalif's wrongs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
the establishment of a Khilafat kingdom in the
country. When, therefore, the British Government
interfered with the activities of some of
the Khilafat leaders the Mohomedan population
as a whole rose in rebellion and invited
the Hindus to join them. The Hindus as a
body remained loyal; and the results were
disastrous both to the Mahomedans and to the
Hindus, more than two thousand Mahomedans
killed by troops according to official estimates,
thousands more in other ways; far larger
numbers wounded; the number of Hindus
butchered in circumstances of barbarity, flayed
alive, made to dig their own graves before
slaughter, running into thousands; women and
purdah women too, raped, not in a fit of
passion but systematically for months passed
from hand to hand and with calculated revolting
and horrible cruelty for which I have not been
able to find a parallel in history. Thousands
were forcibly converted. All this done in
the name of, and to enforce, the Khilafat
movement: all this due directly to the visit
of Gandhi and Shaukat Ali and to the organization
of Khilafat associations. They carried
on their activities openly without any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
obstruction by the authorities; the Government
of Madras was prevented from interfering
with Khilafat agitators by the Government
of India who are therefore as responsible as
if they had directly ordered all this frightfulness.</p>

<p>I take the United Provinces next and will
refer not only to the activities of the volunteers
but to the entire situation as it developed
itself from the commencement of the year
1921. That will also show the earnest efforts
which were made by the Government to
co-operate with the constitutional party to
work the Reform Scheme in a sympathetic
spirit.</p>

<p>In welcoming the Legislative Council on
the 22nd of January, 1921, Sir Harcourt Butler
drew attention to the great efforts which
were being made by Mr. Gandhi's party to
achieve their objects, to their aim, to their
failure till that time to achieve any appreciable
success (App. VII). By March the
situation had become worse and he narrated
the circumstances which compelled him to
extend the Seditious Meetings Act to some
of the districts (App. VIII). By the end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
of the year the situation became intolerable.
Sir Harcourt Butler has described the
efforts of the Non-co-operators, and the
success they have achieved, in his speech
on the 17th December 1921 (App. IX).</p>

<p>And finally Sir Ludovic Porter, a member
of the Government, described the whole
situation, including the various efforts that
were being made by the Non-co-operators
on the 23rd of January 1922 (App. X).
This will explain also the nature of the
associations of volunteers formed under the
Resolution of the Congress already referred to,
their efforts and their illegal character. And
more recently we now hear of far more serious
disturbances in Gorakhpur where a mob
of volunteers and villagers about 2000 in
number led by the former killed 21 policemen
and chowkidars (App. XII) and at
Rai Bareilly where there was a serious
collision. In order to understand the <i>modus
operandi</i> I give an official narrative of
the events at Barabanki (App. XI). About
Behar we have the speech of Mr. Macpherson,
a member of Council, in which he
refers to the plans of the non-co-operation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
party to win Swaraj, gives the organization of
the national volunteers describes how the
Government offices were to be taken possession
of, civil disobedience was to be started,
gives the deplorable conditions in various
districts brought about by the non-co-operation
campaign and describes the revolutionary
character of the movement in that province
(App. XVI). The chief secretary, Mr.
Hammond, in his speech gives various instances
of tyranny practised by the non-co-operation
volunteers, a practical speech which proves his
contention (App. XVII). In Bengal, on Nov.
20 Lord Ronaldshay drew attention to the
nature of Gandhi Swaraj and Turkish administration
(App. XIII). In Nov. 1921, he spoke
about the intended boycott of the Prince of
Wales (App. XIII). In another speech he
pointed out the lies that were being spread
about the bombardment of Mecca (App. XIII).
In Dec. 1921, he described the activities which
led to the interference of Government. A brief
extract will be found in (App. XII). Finally,
in Feb. 1922, he made a lengthy reference to
the political outlook (App. XIII). In the Legislative
Council Sir Henry Wheeler a member
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
of Government described the situation (App. XV).</p>

<p>In the Legislative Assembly also the matter
was fully discussed in Jan. 1922. Sir William
Vincent summed up the situation, various
instances of their activities among which will
be found a particularly revolting statement
about the corpse of a diseased person who was
loyal to the Government, and therefore
obnoxious to Gandhi's party, being dug out of
the grave (App. XXIII).</p>

<p>This completes my review of the situation.
Considerations of space have compelled me to
exclude many speeches which would throw
further light on the situation.</p>

<p>I will, therefore, content myself with giving
a list of the disturbances and riots throughout
India, due to Gandhi's movement supplied to
me by the Legislative Department of the
Government of India (App. XXII).</p>

<p>In February 1922 Mr. Gandhi issued an
ultimatum to the Government of India that
if within a certain period of time his demands
formulated in his ultimatum were not conceded
he would start what is called mass civil disobedience
at Bardoli, that is to say, the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
of Bardoli would be asked to refuse to pay
taxes etc. The Government of India issued a
communique in reply in which reviewing the
situation they pointed out the grave dangers
that would follow such civil disobedience and
gave him a stern warning (App. XIX).</p>

<p>This attitude no doubt surprised him. The
Government he thought was on the run, when
they had submitted meekly to his contemptuous
refusal for a conference at Calcutta and he had
apparently therefore expected them to beg for an
armistice. There was a remarkable change.
He or rather the working committee of the
Congress suspended mass civil disobedience
having found a pretext in the occurrence of a
riot about this time at Gorakhpur. So far as the
campaign against the Government is concerned
the following are the important resolutions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"The working Committee of the Congress resolves
that mass civil disobedience contemplated at Bardoli
and elsewhere be suspended and instructs the local Congress
Committees forthwith to advise the cultivators to
pay the land revenue and other taxes due to the Government
and whose payment might have been suspended in
anticipation of mass civil disobedience and instructs
them to suspend every other preparatory activity of an
offensive nature." "The suspension of mass civil disobedience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
 shall be continued till the atmosphere is so
non-violent as to ensure the non-repetition of popular
atrocities such as at Gorakhpur, or hooliganism such as
at Bombay and Madras respectively on the 17th November,
1921 and 13th January last. In order to promote
a peaceful atmosphere the working Committee advises
till further instruction, all Congress organisations to
stop activities specially designed to court arrest and
imprisonment, save normal Congress activities including
voluntary hartals wherever an absolutely peaceful atmosphere
can be assured, and for that end all picketing shall
be stopped save for the bona fide and peaceful purpose
of warning the visitors to liquor shops against the evils
of drinking. Such picketing to be controlled by persons
of known good character and specially selected by the
Congress Committee concerned."</p>

<p>"The working Committee advises, till further instructions,
the stoppage of all volunteer processions and public
meetings merely for the purpose of defiance of the
notification regarding such meetings. This, however,
shall not interfere with the private meetings of the Congress
and other committees or public meetings which are
required for the conduct of the normal activities of the
Congress".</p>

<p>The working Committee advised all Congress
organisations to be engaged in the following activities:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To enlist at least one crore of members of the
Congress. The workers should note that no one who
does not pay the annual subscription can be regarded as
a qualified congressman."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span></p>

<p>"To continue the Swaraj fund and to call upon
every Congressman or Congress-sympathiser to pay at
least one hundredth part of his annual income for the year
1921. Every province to send every month 25 per cent
of its income from the Tilak Memorial Swaraj fund to
the All-India Congress Committee."</p>

</div>

<p>The above resolutions were directed to be
placed before the All-India Congress Committee
for revision if necessary. They were
accordingly brought before the All-India
Congress Committee whose Resolution runs
thus.</p>

<div class="notequote">

<p>"The All-India Congress Committee have carefully
considered the resolutions passed by the Working
Committee at its meeting held at Bardoli on the 11th
and 12th instant, confirms the said resolutions with the
modifications noted herein and <i>further resolves that
individual civil disobedience whether of a defensive or
aggressive character, may be commenced in respect of
particular places or particular laws, at the instance of,
and upon permission being granted therefore, by the respective
provincial Committee</i>.</p>

<p>"Provided that such civil disobedience shall not be
permitted unless all the conditions laid down by the
Congress or the All-India Congress Committee or the
Working Committee are strictly fulfilled.</p>

<p>"Reports having been received from various quarters
that picketing regarding foreign cloth is as necessary as
liquor picketing, the All-India Congress Committee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
 <i>authorises such picketing</i> of a bona fide character on the
same terms as liquor picketing mentioned in the Bardoli
resolutions.</p>

<p>"The All-India Congress Committee wishes it to be
understood that the resolutions of the Working Committee
do not mean an abandonment of the original
Congress programme of non-co-operation or the
permanent abandonment of mass civil disobedience,
but considers that an atmosphere of necessary
mass non-violence can be established by the workers
concentrating upon the constructive programme framed
by the Working committee at Bardoli. The All-India
Congress Committee holds civil <i>disobedience to be the
right and duty of the people to be exercised and performed
whenever the State opposed the declared will of
the people</i>."</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></div>

<h2>INDIVIDUAL CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE</h2>

<div class="notequote">

<p>Note.&mdash;Individual civil disobedience is disobedience
of orders or laws by a single individual or an ascertained
number or group of individuals. Therefore, a prohibited
public meeting where admission is regulated by tickets
and to which no unauthorised admission is allowed, is
an instance of individual civil disobedience whereas a
prohibited meeting to which the general public is
admitted without any restriction, is an instance of mass
civil disobedience.</p>

<p>Such civil disobedience is defensive, when a prohibited
public meeting is held for conducting a normal activity
although it may result in arrest. It would be aggressive,
if it is held, not for any activity, but merely for the
purpose of courting arrest and imprisonment.</p>

</div>

<p>This shows that there is practically no
change in the situation. This may be read
with the resolution of the congress 28th Dec.
1921 (App. XX). Gandhi's agitation continues
revolutionary.</p>

<p>For more than thirty years the constitutional
Reform party have been fighting for various
indispensable reforms in the administration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
the country with but moderate success. At
last however, in 1919 they obtained a Reform
scheme which brought India directly on to the
path leading to Home Rule. In fact the
Reform Act made Home Rule inevitable within
a comparatively short time, and indicated
the nature of the constitutional methods of its
early attainment. Mr. Gandhi was in India
for some years before that date. He scarcely
lent any assistance to the Reform
party. Considering his principles he could
not. After having obtained the Act, the
Reform party proceeded to work it, to carry
out the administrative reforms needed, to
educate the masses to enable them to claim
and exercise larger political powers, in order
to claim at as early a date as possible that
further instalment of Reform provided for and
contemplated in the act itself. Mr. Gandhi is
standing right athwart their path, thus
preventing or at least retarding and dangerously
imperilling the indispensable reforms,
regardless of the sufferings of the people entailed
thereby, in order to carry out his own
wild principles which have not the slightest
chance of acceptance provided they are understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
by the people of the country for what
they are, emotional speculations without any
considered relation to existing conditions. Mr.
Gandhi, to take him at his best is indifferent to
facts. Facts must submit to the dictates of
his theories. The only difficulty in his way is
that they don't. Will o'the wisp politics are not
of use to a people who have to live in a world
which, from long and bitter experience, has at
last come to realise that dreams of distorted
brains are not the stuff of which contented
Nations are made. Gandhi in fact is seeking
not only to destroy the fruits of the long
endeavour of the constitutional reformers, but
blast for ever any hopes of Indian regeneration.</p>

<p>To push forward the working of the Act
has been the work before the Reform party
which he is thus so perniciously thwarting.
They had to take up in the Legislative Councils
the question of the redress of the
grievances under which the people suffered,
not only to agitate for their removal, but to
show the people that by constitutional agitation
sooner or later they can get what they
want. The most important question with
which the constitutional Reformers had to deal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
was one concerning the great poverty of the
country. For this it is necessary to consider
the question of the Land Tax&mdash;its nature,
incidents, relation to other taxes, its necessity,
the distribution of the land produce between
the Government and the classes that own the
land. This is a question in which the
landholding classes are very much interested.
They would have understood the arguments
addressed to them and therefore it would have
served as a means of political and social
education. The Councils have already been
dealing with it, and, considering the conditions,
satisfactorily. The Government have
been meeting them in a sympathetic spirit
and are trying to give effect to their proposals
as much as possible. What is Mr. Gandhi's
advice? He does not seek to co-operate
to make the tax less oppressive. He would
have the people pay no land tax to Government.
Only the dreadful consequences that
would ensue prevent him in this case, from
giving full effect to his intentions. In any case,
it is not the oppressive nature of the tax that he
relies on, nor is it alleged that it is an innovation
of the British Government, which of course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
it is not. He objects to the tax, not for itself,
but because it is another weapon with which to
destroy the Government.</p>

<p>A cognate question is that which arises
between the landlords and tenants. In this
also all the landholding classes are deeply interested,
and a discussion of the nature of the
distribution of the produce between the landlord,
farmer and agricultural labourer would
have been of great educative value. The
Legislative Councils are dealing with the
question. Government in this matter also are
showing the greatest possible consideration for
the feelings of the people of the country. Yet
Mr. Gandhi and his friends would not only take
no part in the deliberations of the council but
would prevent an amicable settlement by steps
which have produced riots between the classes
interested in the land, with the object of discrediting
the Reform Scheme and paralysing
the Government of the country.</p>

<p>Closely connected with this is the question of
Indian manufactures, industries and the development
of mineral resources, which, besides,
conferring other benefits, will relieve undue
pressure on the land. Our industries have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
destroyed by English competition and constitutional
reformers are determined to take all
the steps necessary to enter into healthy
competition with English industries in Indian
interests and to develop their own mineral
and other resources. In so doing they have
to take care that the conditions which
accompanied the rise of industrial prosperity
in the West are not reproduced in India.
They have to see that wage earners received
adequate protection. What are the tactics of
Mr. Gandhi and his friends? All these industries
are to him the devil's-own agency
to destroy the soul. He says they cannot add
an inch to India's moral stature. Starvation
due to the absence of industries may destroy
the body and certainly hinders the development
of the soul. But to him this does not
matter. He and his followers would taboo
machinery, without which competition or development
is hopeless. Without attempting
to promote an amicable settlement between
English capitalists and Indian labourers they
have on the contrary been responsible for a
deliberate widening of the chasm between the
races.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
The administration of justice is another
matter in which all are interested; and already
the Legislative Councils are dealing with the
question of the separation of Judicial and
Executive functions. The Government again
are not only not standing in their way but
are rendering every assistance towards the
solution of the problem. This is also the
case with reference to the removal of discriminations
between Europeans and Indians in the
administration of justice. The people of the
country understand this question well as they
are deeply interested in it. Mr. Gandhi is
asking the people of the country to avoid all
courts and thus not to interest themselves in
the improvement of judicial administration.</p>

<p>I might take many other questions relating
to finances, army, etc., and show the baneful
influence of his propaganda. In all these
Mr. Gandhi's campaign against Government
has hampered the reformers who would otherwise
have made the redress of these grievances
a more effective plank in their platform;
these questions would have been more widely
discussed throughout the country. But such
discussion is now almost impossible with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
result that these questions are not settled as
satisfactorily as they might otherwise be. But
it is as regards education that the reformers have
most felt the want of that popular support
necessary to carry out the reforms needed.</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi will never be forgiven by all
true lovers of sound National Education for
India for the campaign he has carried on
against real education. The education that has
been hitherto imparted had been as everybody,
including Mr. Gandhi also recognised, lamentably
defective. The reformers had to
insist on the imparting of suitable primary
education to the masses, to the workers, to the
labouring men and others, to enable them to
improve their condition, because no class can
generally rise except under the ultimate stress
of its own will and ability. They had to demand
suitable higher education, which was required
not only in the interests of the culture but also
for the industrial regeneration of the country
and for the development of India's natural resources.
In the laboratories of Europe, America
and Japan students are devoting themselves to
discover means for the alleviation of misery
and pain. Nay, higher claims are advanced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
for it has been declared by scientists that we
are on the eve of discovery of means for a
practically indefinite prolongation of life under
certain conditions which make us intensely expectant
to know whether they are the same as
described in our ancient books as efficacious for
that purpose, descriptions which have hitherto
been contemptuously discarded as worthless.
Archaeologists are almost every day unveiling to
us ancient remains and writings which give us
a different and a startling conception of ancient
History and Civilisation. Indian History is
being rewritten. When we hear of the Marconi
wireless, our young men turn to our own
ancient descriptions of the training of human
body and mind which make these fit to receive
and convey messages regardless of space and
distance and they show eagerness to take part
in experiment and research. When we find
rays penetrating solid matter, our young
scientists wonder whether after all the stories of
great seers whose vision, not of the material
eye, is not bounded by time or space or distance,
may not be true and wonder whether we
should not now take up the training prescribed
to attain those results. Researches are made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
in the laboratories to control the forces of
nature, to increase human comforts and
happiness, to increase productivity in all directions.
Researches have already attained brilliant
results. The lessons of the survey of the
regions above by the telescope, of all below by
the microscope, and generally speaking all
these marvels of science which lend fresh light
and new significance to the lesson of ancients
as to the all pervading of the universe are all
anathema to Mr. Gandhi.</p>

<p>He wants to hold back our boys from the
Universities and post-graduate studies and
research that they may go back to their ploughs
while the Universities of the Western world
are sending their delegates all over the world
to take stock of what has been done and to
devise means for the intellectual and moral
uplift of the Nations.</p>

<p>The constitutional reformers and the
Councils have the great task before them of
reconciling the Hindus and Mahomedans on a
basis for their unity other than the one which
arose out of the Mahomedan fury against
the British Government for its failure to
support Mahomedan interests in the West.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
They have also to promote goodwill between
the Hindus and the Mahomedans on the one
side and the Europeans on the other, both in
India and in the colonies. They have to face the
rising antagonism between the dark, the fair
and the white&mdash;an antagonism which threatens
in course of time to engulf the whites with all
that modern civilisation, whatever be its faults,
is standing for. The Reform party want
India to take her rightful place in the Indo-British
commonwealth, the first place, in fact,
to which her natural genius and her resources
entitle her, with all its responsibilities. The
conditions are all favourable to India.
Governorships of Provinces are thrown open
to Indians. There are Indians in the Viceroy's
and other Councils. But Mr. Gandhi and his
friends will not only do practically nothing in
that direction but they have created what
threatens to be a permanent gulf between the
Mahomedans and non-Mahomedans, and they
are dangerously widening the gulf between the
Indians and Europeans. The reformers have
to improve the conditions of women both
amongst the Mahomedans and the Hindus, as
without such improvement India is not entitled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
to take her place among civilised nations.
They have practically to get rid of the caste
system as with such a cancer political progress
is impossible. Mr. Gandhi, on the other hand,
panders to Mahomedan vanity and justifies the
racial differences as between different classes
of Hindus. He insists upon the necessity of
our going back to our own caste system,
which is responsible for the condition of our
women and of the lower classes. He has
given a handle to those who want to maintain
the repressive laws, and is really responsible
for the retention of them. He has not only
thrown doubts as to our fitness for Self-Government
but has rendered it possible for
our opponents to urge with plausibility that
danger would accrue to the Empire and to
India itself by granting Home Rule to India.
He has thus to the best of his sinister ability
attempted to prevent all reforms and has tried
to paralyse all the efforts of the reformers in
every direction, fomenting racial and class
differences, as I have already explained.</p>

<p>Everywhere we see a class of narrow
thought in the white world raising the colour
sentiment against the Asiatics, and against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
Indians in particular, proclaiming that there
is no place for Indians in British Empire on
terms of equality. These are not the
intellectual leaders of the white races, nor are
they those who set the best standards of morality.
On the other hand, we see the noblest of
them proclaiming and striving with all their
might, with varying degrees of success, to enforce
the opposite ideal. We know also that
in India the question is only one of time and
within a short period absolute equality in every
respect will be carried out. We see further
that our countrymen elsewhere are weak and
comparatively helpless, and till we in India
attain our manhood they must continue at the
mercy of the white races. What is it, then,
that not only Religion, Universal morality, or
good, but also policy and prudence, dictate?
There can be only one answer. We must
strengthen the hands of those who are fighting
for race equality and give no opportunity to
those who maintain that the Indians are a peril
to the white race. What is Mr. Gandhi doing?
He is doing everything possible to increase
racial and class hatred.</p>

<p>We see the wonderful phenomenon of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
Australian ladies begging pardon for the
atrocious treatment of their Indian sisters by a
few Englishmen in Fiji and elsewhere. We
see the Universities and Professors, ashamed
of themselves for their aberration during the
great War, hastening to make amends by
trying to bring together all classes and races
of men. We see white women trying to band
themselves and other women of whatever
colour and creed into one sisterhood, without
any difference, to throw themselves into all
social and political movements for sex enfranchisement
and uplift; to work for the good
not only of themselves but of children in particular,
and generally to devote themselves to all
activities of mercy. We find various Nations
calling to one another across seas, deserts and
mountains to join in a common fellowship, not
to work in opposition to one another. Every
where, after the fearful cataclysm through
which we have passed, there is wistful yearning
for fellowship and brother-hood to carry out in
practice the teachings of the ancient prophets
and seers, Buddha, Confucius, Zoroaster, the
seers of the Upanishads, Christ, Mahomed, in
opposition to the Churches and the dogmatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
religions identified with their names. And is
it not extraordinary, we see this man, uninfluenced
by this tremendous intellectual and
moral up-heaval, waging a bloody and racial
struggle for what? that if successful Indians
may not take part in any of these movements,
shun them all, since God has not created man
with his limited means of natural locomotion
to labour for general good, and may therefore,
retire to their village to lead a solitary life.</p>

<p>If he had followed this advice for himself,
or had retired to the Himalayas to live a
mahatmaic life he would have saved the lives
literally of thousands, prevented horrible outrages
worse than death, saved thousands from
incalculable misery. Instead of paying the
penalty themselves, he and his lieutenants
stalk about the country dripping with the blood
of the victims of their policy.</p>

<p>Who is responsible for all this? The
Government of India cannot divest themselves
of their responsibility and India will hold the
Indian members primarily responsible for the
present situation. For no Viceroy will venture
to disregard their advice in a matter of this
sort. They do not seem to have strengthened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
the fibre of the Government. Nor have the
Legislative Councils who also must share the
responsibility advanced the claim for the transfer
of the administration of justice to popular
control. The Gandhi movement will no doubt
collapse by internal disruption as it is composed
of various elements, drawn from Tolstoy
Lenin communism, socialism, Rigid Brahmanism,
militant Mahomedanism mutually repellent
and explosive when they come into contact
with one another and already producing the
natural terrible results. But before the final
collapse comes it will have produced appalling
misery and bloodshed unless it is dealt with
firmly and with statesmanship. The Government
should give Mr. Gandhi and some of his
chief lieutenants who accept the whole programme
the rest, they sadly need. And the
Congress and the Khilafat associations must
be treated as they themselves wish to be treated
as disloyal illegal associations.</p>

<p>Since the above lines were written Mr.
Gandhi has been arrested, tried and convicted.
He pleaded guilty to the charges framed
against him. His statements are worthy of
careful attention (App. XXI). He said "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
wish to endorse all the blame that the learned
Advocate-General has thrown on my shoulders
in connection with the Bombay occurrences,
Madras occurrences and the Chauri Chaura
occurrences. Thinking over these deeply and
sleeping over them night after night, it is
impossible for me to dissociate myself from the
diabolical crimes of Chauri Chaura or the mad
outrages of Bombay." He is quite right when
he says, that "as a man of responsibility, a man
having received a fair share of education, having
had fair share of experience of this world,
I should have known the consequences of every
one of my acts. <i>I knew that I was playing
with fire. I ran the risk and if I was set free
I would still do the same.</i> I have felt it this
morning that I would have failed in my duty,
if I did not say what I said here just now."
A man who says that if set free he would still
pursue the same course though aware of the
consequences of his acts is not a safe leader.
There are signs however of a general recognition
throughout the country that Mr. Gandhi's
theories are no longer suitable as a guide for
political action. The Maharashtra party have
apparently resolved to seek admission into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
Legislative councils. The Central Provinces
are also apparently of the same opinion. A
large section of Bengal represented by the
Chitagong conference apparently hold the same
view. In Madras a considerable section is
inclined to agree. But there is little doubt that
it would take a long time to eradicate the
feeling of hatred that has been roused
by Mr. Gandhi throughout the country.</p>

<p>As I left the Government of India long before
the campaign of non-co-operation was
launched, perhaps there is nothing inappropriate
in the few observations which I propose to
make regarding the delay in taking action
against Mr. Gandhi and his followers. In
September 1920 the Congress adopted the
non-co-operation resolution. The Government
might then have taken action with the support
of a large majority of Indian politicians.
After the final adoption of a non-co-operation
programme by the Nagpur Congress it
was felt that the Government should have
stopped the activities of the party which from
that moment had openly declared their
disloyalty. They maintained their silence however
even after Gandhi and the Congress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
party resolved on the recruitment of volunteers
and the organisation of a parallel Government.
On the arrest and trial of the Ali Brothers Mr.
Gandhi challenged the Government to arrest
him as he maintained that the conduct of the Ali
Brothers in tampering with the loyalty of the
Sepoys and uttering sedition was only in pursuance
of the policy adopted by himself and
the congress. His words are remarkable. "The
National Congress began to tamper with the
loyalty of the sepoys in September last year,
<i>i.e.</i> 1920 the Central Khilafat Committee
began it earlier and I began it earlier still,
for I must be permitted to take the credit or
the odium of suggesting, that India had a
right openly to tell the sepoy and everyone
who served the Government in any capacity
whatsoever that he participated in the wrongs
done by the Government."&mdash;"Every non-co-operator
is pledged to preach disaffection
towards the Government established by law.
Non-co-operation, though, a religious and
strictly moral movement, deliberately aims at
the overthrow of the Government, and is therefore
legally seditious in terms of the Indian
Penal Code. But this is no new discovery.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
Lord Chelmsford knew it. Lord Reading
knows it" ... "we must reiterate from a
thousand platforms the formula of the Ali
Brothers regarding the sepoys, and we must
spread disaffection openly and systematically
till it pleases the Government to arrest us." It
will hardly be believed that even after this no
steps were taken against him. Towards the
end of the year he said "Lord Reading must
clearly understand that the non-co-operators are
at war with the Government. They have
declared rebellion against it." It was after this
that there was an attempt to bring about a conference
between him and the Government
which was contemptuously brushed aside by
him. One of the mopla leaders when tried
for rebellion pleaded that he was under the
impression that the British Government no
longer ruled the country and had abdicated.
There is very little doubt of the unfortunate
fact that there was a general belief that the
Government was powerless and could be safely
defied by Gandhi and his congress.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX I<br />
    VICEROY'S SPEECH.</h2>

<p>"A few Europeans and many Hindus, have been murdered,
communications have been obstructed, Government offices burnt
and looted and records have been destroyed, Hindu temples sacked,
houses of Europeans and Hindus burnt, according to reports
Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam and one of the most
fertile tracts of South India is faced with certain famine. The
result has been the temporary collapse of the Civil Government,
the offices and Courts have ceased to function and ordinary business
has been brought to a standstill. European and Hindu
refugees of all classes are concentrated at Calicut and it is satisfactory
to note that they are safe there. One trembles to think of the
consequences if the forces of order had not prevailed for the protection
of Calicut. The non Muslim in these parts was fortunate
indeed that either he or his family or his house or property came
under the protection of the soldiers and the police. Those who
are responsible for causing this grave outbreak of violence and
crime must be brought to justice and made to suffer the punishment
of the guilty.</p>

<h3>Effect of violent preaching</h3>

<p>"But apart from direct responsibility, can it be doubted that
when poor unfortunate and deluded people are led to believe that
they should disregard the law and defy authority, violence and
crime must follow? This outbreak is but another instance on a
much more serious scale and among a more turbulent and fanatical
people, of the conditions that have manifested themselves at times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
in various parts of the country and, gentlemen, I ask myself and
you and the country generally what else can be the result from
instilling such doctrines into the minds of the masses of the
people? How can there be peace and tranquility when ignorant
people, who have no means of testing the truth of the inflamatory
and too often deliberately false statements made to them, are thus
misled by those whose design is to provoke violence and disorder.
Passions are thus easily excited to unreasoning fury.</p>

<h3>The Leader of the Movement</h3>

<p>"Although, I freely acknowledge that the leader of the movement
to paralyse authority, persistently, and, as I believe, in all
earnestness and sincerity, preaches the doctrine of non-violence
and has even reproved his followers for resorting to it, yet again
and again it has been showed that his doctrine is completely forgotten
and his exhortations absolutely disregarded when passions
are excited as must inevitably be the consequence among emotional
people.</p>

<h3>Its inevitable result</h3>

<p>"To those who are responsible for the peace and good government
of this great Empire and I trust that to all men of sanity and
common sense in all classes of society, it must be clear that the
defiance of the Government and constituted authority can only
result in widespread disorder, in political chaos, in anarchy and in
ruin."</p>

<h2>APPENDIX II<br />
    DIABOLICAL ATROCITIES.</h2>

<p>Calicut, Sept. 7&mdash;In my first article I dealt with the prime
causes of the present outbreak, the dangerous game played by the
leaders of the Khilafat and Non-Co-operation movements in Malabar
which set the whole of Ernad and Walluvanad ablaze, and the
extent of plunders, murders and forcible conversions committed
by the Mopla rebels. In this article I intend to confine myself to
the nature of the atrocities committed by them and other details.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
The experiences I am about to relate will satisfy every Hindu
endowed with ordinary common sense that the Moplas resorted to
most repugnant fanaticism, which may be ascribed to nothing but
selfishness, love of money and love of power, which are the prominent
features of the present outbreak. Refugees narrate that,
after forcibly removing young and fair Nair and other high caste
girls from their parents and husbands, the Mopla rebels stripped
them of their clothing and made them march in their presence
naked, and finally they committed rape upon them. In certain
instances, devoid of human feelings and blinded by animal passion,
the Moplas are alleged to have utilised a single woman for the
gratification of the carnal pleasures of a dozen or more men. The
rebels also seem to have captured beautiful Hindu women, forcibly
converted them, pierced holes in their ears in the typical Mopla
fashion, dressed them as Mopla women and utilised them as their
temporary partners in life. Hindu women were threatened,
molested and compelled to run half-naked for shelter to forests
abounding in wild animals. Respectable Hindu gentlemen were
forcibly converted and the circumcision ceremony performed with
the help of certain Musaliars and Thangals. Hindu houses were
looted and set fire to, will not all these atrocities remain as a
shameful image of the Hindu Muslim "unity", of which we have
heard much from the Non-Co-operation Party and Khilafat-wallahs?
The ghastly spectacle of a number of Hindu damsels
being forced to march naked in the midst of a number of licentious
Moplas cannot be forgotten by any self respecting Hindu, nor can
it be erased from their minds. On the other hand, I have never
heard of the modesty of a Mopla woman being outraged by a
Mopla rebel. "<i>Times of India.</i>"</p>

<h2>APPENDIX III<br />
    MALABAR'S AGONY.</h2>

<h3>By Annie Besant</h3>

<p>It would be well if Mr. Gandhi could be taken into Malabar
to see with his own eyes the ghastly horrors which have been
created by the preaching of himself and his "loved brothers,"
Muhommad and Shaukat Ali. The Khilafat Raj is established
there; on August 1, 1921, sharp to the date first announced
by Mr. Gandhi for the beginning of Swaraj and the vanishing
of British Rule, a Police Inspector was surrounded by
Moplas, revolting against that Rule. From that date onwards
thousands of the forbidden war-knives ware secretly made
and hidden away, and on August 20, the rebellion broke
out, Khilafat flags were hoisted on Police Stations and
Government offices. Strangely enough it was on August 25th
825 A.D. that Cherman Perumal ascended the throne of Malabar,
the first Zamorin, and from that day the Malayalam Era is dated
that is still in use; thus for 1096 years a Zamorin has ruled in
Calicut, and the Rajas are mostly Chiefs who for long centuries
have looked to a Zamorin as their feudatory Head. These are the
men on whom the true pacification of Malabar must ultimately
depend. The crowded refugees will only return to their devastated
homes when they see those once more in safety in their ancestral
places. Their lands, which they keep under their own control, are
largely cultivated by Moplas, who are normally hardy, industrious
agricultural labourers.</p>

<p>Our correspondent has sent accounts of the public functions
connected with my hurried visit to Calicut and Palghat, and that
which I wish to put on record here is the ghastly misery which
prevails, the heart-breaking wretchedness which has been caused
by the Mopla outbreak, directly due to the violent and unscrupulous
attacks on the Government made by the Non-Co-operators and the
Khilafatists and the statements scattered broadcast, predicting the
speedy disappearance of British Rule, and the establishment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
Swaraj, as proclaimed by the N.C.O. and Khilafat Raj as understood
by the Moplas from the declarations of the Khilafatists. On
that, there is no doubt whatever, so far as Malabar is concerned.
The message of the Khilafats, of England as the enemy of Islam,
of her coming downfall, and the triumph of the Muslims, had
spread, to every Mopla home. The harangues in the Mosques
spread it everywhere, and Muslim hearts were glad. They saw
the N.C.O. preachers appealing for help to their religious leaders,
naturally identified the two. The Government was Satanic, and
Eblis, to the good Muslim, is to be fought to the death. Mr. Gandhi
may talk as he pleases about N.C.O.s accepting no responsibility.
It is not what they accept; it is what facts demonstrate. He accepted
responsibility for the trifling bloodshed of Bombay. The slaughter
in Malabar cries out his responsibility. N.C.O. is dead in Malabar.
But bitter hatred has arisen there, as fighting men from the
dragon's teeth of Theseus. That is the ghastly result of the
preaching of Gandhism, of N.C.O. of Khilafatism. Every one
speaks of the Khilafat Raj, and the one hope of the masses is in its
crushing by the strong arm of the Government. Mr. Gandhi asks
the Moderates to compel the Government to suspend hostilities,
<i>i.e.</i>, to let loose the wolves to destroy what lives are left. The
sympathy of the Moderates is not, I make bold to say, with the
murderers, the looters, the ravishers, who have put into practice
the teachings of paralysing the Government of the N.C.O.'s, who
have made "war on the Government" in their own way. How
does Mr. Gandhi like the Mopla spirit, as shown by one of the
prisoners in the Hospital, who was dying from the results of
asphyxiation? He asked the surgeon, if he was going to die, and
surgeon answered that he feared he would not recover. "Well, I'm
glad I killed fourteen infidels," said the Brave, God-fearing Mopla,
whom Mr. Gandhi so much admires, who "are fighting for what
they consider as religion, and in a manner they consider as
religious." Men who consider it "religious" to murder, rape, loot,
to kill women and little children, cutting down whole families,
have to be put under restraint in any civilised society.</p>

<p>Mr. Gandhi was shocked when some Parsi ladies had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
their saries torn off, and very properly, yet the God-fearing
hooligans had been taught that it was sinful to wear foreign
cloth, and doubtless felt they were doing a religious act;
can he not feel a little sympathy for thousands of women left
with only rags, driven from home, for little children born of
the flying mothers on roads in refuge camps? The misery is
beyond description. Girl wives, pretty and sweet, with eyes half
blind with weeping, distraught with terror; women who have seen
their husbands hacked to pieces before their eye, in the way "Moplas
consider as religious"; old women tottering, whose faces become
written with anguish and who cry at a gentle touch and a kind look
waking out of a stupor of misery only to weep, men who have lost
all, hopeless, crushed, desperate, I have walked among thousands
of them in the refugee camps, and some times heavy eyes would
lift as a cloth was laid gently on the bare shoulder, and a faint
watery smile of surprise would make the face even more piteous
than the stupor. Eyes full of appeal, of agonised despair, of hopeless
entreaty of helpless anguish, thousands of them camp after
camp, "Shameful inhumanity proceeding in Malabar," says Mr.
Gandhi. Shameful inhumanity indeed, wrought by the Moplas, and
these are the victims, saved from extermination by British and
Indian swords, For be it remembered the Moplas began the whole
horrible business; the Government intervened to save their victims
and these thousands have been saved. Mr. Gandhi would have
hostilities suspended&mdash;so that the Moplas may sweep down on the
refugee camps, and finish their work?</p>

<p>I visited in Calicut three huge Committee camps, two Christian,
and the Congress building and compound where doles of rice
are given daily from 7 <small>A.M.</small> to noon. In all, the arrangements were
good. Big thatched sheds, and some buildings shelter the women
and children, the men sleep outside. They are all managed by
Indians, the Zamorini's Committee distributing cloths and money to
all, except the Congress committee, which work independently and
gives food from its own resource. At Palghat, similar arrangements
are made by the Zamorini's Committee, and the order and
care in feeding are good to see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
Let me finish with a beautiful story told to me. Two Pulayas,
the lowest of the submerged classes, were captured with others,
and given the choice between Islam and Death. These, the outcaste
of Hinduism, the untouchables, so loved the Hinduism which had
been so unkind a step-mother to them, that they chose to die
Hindus rather than to live Muslim. May the God of both, Muslim
and Hindus send His messengers to these heroic souls, and give
them rebirth into the Faith for which they died. <i>New India, 29
November 1921.</i></p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter"></div>

<p>Wilful murders of Hindus and arson were first begun in my
own place by Chembrasseri Thangal and his Lieutenant, another
Thangal. You might have read accounts written by me in the
Malabar journal which was sent to you last time. This contagion
began to spread like wild fire and we began to hear of murders
daily. Within a fortnight cold-blooded murders of Hindus became
very common. From within the borders of Calicut and Ernad
taluks refugees come in large numbers with tales of murders and
atrocities committed by the rebels. At Puthur Amson in Ernad
only 12 miles northeast of Calicut&mdash;One day in broad daylight
twenty-five persons who refused to embrace Islam were butchered
and put into a well. One out of these who narrowly escaped death
got out of the well when the rebels left the place and ran to Calicut
for life. He is now in the hospital. So the accounts must be true
as he himself was one of the victims.</p>

<p>During the last week news of numerous murders and forcible
conversions came from another quarter also, Mannur
near Aniyallur and Kadalundi railway station in Ernad taluk.
This place also is only 14 miles away from Calicut. Every
train to Calicut was carrying with it daily hundreds of refugees
during the last week. If there were ten thousand refugees fed by
the Relief Committee last week, it must have fed fifteen thousand
this week. According to the statements given by them there must
be at least fifty murders and numerous cases of conversions and
house-burning. Can you conceive of a more ghastly and inhuman
crime than the murders of babies and pregnant women? Two days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
back I had occasion to read a report given by a refugee in Calicut.
A pregnant woman carrying 7 months was cut through the abdomen
by a rebel and she was seen lying dead on the way with the
dead child projecting out of the womb. How horrible! Another:
a baby of six months was snatched away from the breast of his
own mother and cut into two pieces. How heart-rending! Are
these rebels human beings or monsters? From the same quarters
numerous forcible conversions are also reported. One refugee
has given statement that he had seen with his own eyes that the
heads of a dozen people were being shaved by the rebels and afterwards
they were asked to recite some passages from the <i>Quran</i>.
This he witnessed from a tree. I wonder what is the authority of
some people who contradict the news of murders, and forcible conversions
of Hindus. Let them come here and test the veracity of
these statements for themselves.</p>

<p>'Yesterday another report of murders came from a place very
near Kottakal. The report says that eleven Hindus (males and
females), were murdered by the rebels.</p>

<p>'A fortnight ago fifteen dead bodies of Hindus were seen under
culvert on the road between Perinialmanna and Melatur.'</p>

<p>Will you not be sick of these stories of murders? All these
reports are, as far as possible, proved also to be correct.</p>

<p>Words fail to express my feelings of indignation and abhorrence
which I experienced when I came to know of an instance of
rape, committed by the rebels under Chembrasseri Thangal. A
respectable Nayar Lady at Melatur was stripped naked by the
rebels in the presence of her husband and brothers, who were made
to stand close by with their hands tied behind. When they shut
their eyes in abhorrence they were compelled at the point of sword
to open their eyes and witness the rape committed by the brute in
their presence. I loathe even to write of such a mean action. I
thank God that my family and relatives reached safe at Calicut
without being dishonoured by these brutes, though we sustained
serious loss of property and the loss of four lives (two servants and
two relatives,&mdash;More afterwards). This instance of rape was communicated
to me by one of her brothers confidentially. There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
several instances of such mean atrocities which are not revealed by
people. <i>New India 6th Dec. 1921.</i></p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter"></div>

<p>Truth is infinitely of more paramount importance than Hindu-Muslim
unity or Swaraj, and therefore, we tell the Maulana Sahib
and his co-religionists and India's revered leader Mahatma Gandhi&mdash;if
he too is unaware of the events here&mdash;that atrocities committed
by the Moplahs on the Hindus are unfortunately too true and that
there is nothing in the deeds of Moplah rebels which a true non-violent
non-co-operator can congratulate them for. What is
it for which they deserve congratulation? Their wanton and
unprovoked attack on the Hindus, the all but wholesale
looting at their houses in Ernad, and parts of Valluvanad,
Ponnani, and Calicut Taliques; the forcible conversion of
Hindus in a few places in the beginning of the rebellion and
the wholesale conversion of those who stick to their homes
in its later stages, the brutal murder of inoffensive Hindus,
men, women, and children in cold blood, without the slightest
reason except that they are "Kaffirs" or belong to the same race
as the Policemen, who insulted their Tangals or entered their
Mosques, the desecration and burning of Hindu Temples the outrage
on Hindu women and their forcible conversion and marriage
by Moplahs; do these and similar atrocities proved beyond the
shadow of a doubt by the statements recorded by us from the
actual sufferers who have survived, deserve any congratulation?
On the other hand should they not call forth the strongest condemnation
from all right-minded men and more especially from a
representative body of Mohamedans like the Khilafat Conference
pledged to non-violence under all provocation? Did the Moplahs,
who committed such atrocities, sacrifice their lives in the cause of
their religion?</p>

<p>Maulana Mohani justifies the looting of Hindus by Moplahs as
lawful by way of commandeering in a war between the latter and
the Government or as a matter of necessity when the Moplahs
were forced to live in jungles. Maulana perhaps does not know
that in the majority of cases, the almost wholesale looting of
Hindu houses in portions of Ernad, Valluvanad and Ponani
Taluques was perpetrated on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of August
before the military had arrived in the affected area to arrest or
fight the rebels even before Martial law had been declared. The
Moplahs had not betaken themselves to jungles at the time as
Moulana supposes nor had the Hindus as a class done anything to
them to deserve their hostility. The out-break commenced on the
20th of August, the police and the District Magistrate withdrew
from Tirunangadi to Calicut on the 21st and the policemen
throughout the affected area had taken to their heels. There was
no adversary to the Moplahs at the time whom the Hindus could
possibly have helped or invited, and the attack on them was most
wanton and unprovoked.</p>

<p>The humble memorial of the bereaved and sorrow-stricken
women of Malabar.</p>

<p class="smcap">May it please your gracious and
compassionate Ladyship.</p>

<div class="app">

<p>We, the Hindu women of Malabar of varying ranks and stations
in life who have recently been overwhelmed by the tremendous
catastrophe known as the Moplah rebellion, take the liberty
to supplicate your Ladyship for sympathy and succour.</p>

<p>2. Your Ladyship is doubtless aware that though our unhappy
district has witnessed many Moplah outbreaks in the course
of the last one hundred years, the present rebellion is unexampled
in its magnitude as well as unprecedented in its ferocity. But it is
possible that your Ladyship is not fully appraised of all the horrors
and atrocities perpetrated by the fiendish rebels; of the many
wells and tanks filled up with the mutilated, but often only half
dead bodies of our nearest and dearest ones who refused to abandon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
the faith of our fathers; of pregnant women cut to pieces and
left on the roadsides and in the jungles, with the unborn babe protruding
from the mangled corpse; of our innocent and helpless
children torn from our arms and done to death before our eyes and
of our husbands and fathers tortured, flayed and burnt alive; of
our hapless sisters forcibly carried away from the midst of kith
and kin and subjected to every shame and outrage which the vile
and brutal imagination of these inhuman hell-hounds could conceive
of; of thousands of our homesteads reduced to cinder-mounds
out of sheer savagery and a wanton spirit of destruction;
of our places of worship desecrated and destroyed and of the
images of the deity shamefully insulted by putting the entrails of
slaughtered cows where flower garlands used to lie, or else
smashed to pieces; of the wholesale looting of hard earned wealth
of generations reducing many who were formerly rich and prosperous
to publicly beg for a piece or two in the streets of Calicut,
to buy salt or chilly or betel-leaf&mdash;rice being mercifully provided
by the various relief agencies. These are not fables.</p>

<p>The wells full of rotting skeletons, the ruins which once were
our dear homes, the heaps of stones which once were our places of
worship&mdash;these are still here to attest to the truth. The cries of
our murdered children in their death agonies are still ringing in
our ears and will continue to haunt our memory till death brings
us peace. We remember how driven out of our native hamlets we
wandered starving and naked in the jungles and forests; we remember
how we choked and stifled our babies' cries lest the
sound should betray our hiding places to our relentless pursuers.
We still vividly realise the moral and spiritual agony that thousand
of us passed through when we were forcibly converted into the
faith professed by these blood thirsty miscreants; we still have
before us the sight of the unendurable and life long misery of those&mdash;fortunately
few&mdash;of our most unhappy sisters who born and
brought up in respectable families have been forcibly converted
and then married to convict coolies. For five long months not a
day has passed without its dread tale of horror to unfold.</p>

<p>3. Your gracious Ladyship's distracted memorialists have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
endeavoured without exaggeration, without setting down aught in
malice to convey at least some idea of the indescribably terrible
agonies which they and thousands more of their sisters have been
enduring for over five months now through this reign of inhuman
frightfulness inaugurated and carried on in the name of
the Khilafhat. We have briefly referred without going into
their harrowing details to our heartrending tale of dishonour,
outrage, rapine, and desolation. But if the past has been one of
pain and anguish, the future is full of dread and gloom. We have
to return to a ruined and desolated land. Our houses have been
burnt or destroyed; may of our breadwinners killed; all our
property looted; our cattle slaughtered. Repatriation without
compensation means for us ruin, beggary, starvation. Will not the
benign Government come to our aid and give us something to help
us to begin life anew? We are now asked to settle down as paupers
in the midst of the execrable fiends who robbed, insulted and
murdered our loved ones&mdash;veritable demons such as hell itself
could not let loose. Many of us shrink from the idea of going back
to what there is left of our homes; for though the armed bands
and rebels have been dispersed the rebellion cannot be said to be
entirely quelled. It is like a venomous serpent whose spine has
been partly broken, but whose poison fangs are still intact and
whose striking power, if diminished, has not been destroyed.
A few thousands of rebels have been killed and a few more thousands
have been imprisoned, but as the Government are only too well
aware many more thousands of rebels, looters, savagely militant
evangelists and other inhuman monsters yet remain at large, a few
in concealment, but most, moving about with arrogance openly
threatening reprisals on all non-moslims who dare to return and
resume possession of their property. Many refugees who went
back have paid for their temerity with their lives. In fact, repatriation,
if it is not to be a leap from the frying pan into the fire,
must mean for the vast bulk of your Ladyship's impoverished and
helpless memorialists and their families a hard inexorable problem
of financial help, and adequate protection against renewed hellish
outrages from which immunity would be utterly impossible as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
long as thousands of men and even women and children of this
semi-savage and fanatical race in whom the worst instinct of earth
hunger, blood-lust and rapine have been awakened to fierce activity
are free to prey upon their peaceable and inoffensive neighbours
who&mdash;let it be most respectfully emphasised&mdash;because of their
implicit trust in the power and the will of a just and benign
Government to protect them, had suffered their own art and
capacity for selfdefence to emasculate and decay.</p>

<p>4. We, Your Ladyship's humble and sorrow-stricken memorialists
do not seek vengeance. Our misery will not be rendered less
by inflicting similar misery upon this barbarous and savage race;
our dead will not return to us if their slayers are slaughtered. We
would not be human, however, if we could ever forget the cruel
and shameful outrages and indignities perpetrated upon us by a
race to whom we have always endeavoured to be friendly and
neighbourly; we would be hypocritical if, robbed of all our possessions
we did not plead for some measure of compensation to help
us out of the pauperism now forced upon us; we would be imbecile,
if knowing the ungovernable, anti-social propensities and the deadly
religious fanaticism of the moplah race we did not entreat the just
and powerful government to protect the lives and honour of your
humble sisters who have to live in the rebel-ravaged zone. Our
ambition after all is low enough; sufficient compensation to save
us and our children from starvation, and enough military protection
against massacre and outrage are all that we want. We beseech
Your Compassionate Ladyship to exercise all the benevolent
influence that you possess with the government to see that our
humble prayers are granted. But if the benign Government does
not consider it possible to compensate us and to protect us in our
native land we would most fervently pray that free grants of land
may be assigned to us in some neighbouring region which though
less blessed with the lavish gifts of nature may also be less cursed
by the cruelty and brutality of man.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX VI<br />
    ON NON-CO-OPERATION</h2>

</div>

<p class="center smcap">By M. R. Jayakar</p>

<p class="notequote">[We take the following extracts from the Presidential address
of Mr. M. R. Jayakar at the Third Thana District Conference. Mr.
Jayakar is a well-known Non-Co-operator who believes in the
"principles and policy" of the movement and who joined the
movement because he realised that "Our quarrel with the
bureaucracy was far more substantial than our differences with
the Congress Programme."]</p>

<div class="app">

<h3>The Failure of the Programme</h3>

<p>The principles and the policy of the movement (N.C.O.) are
substantially sound and have achieved unexpected success. But,
with every month that has passed, the need has been felt in many
quarters of revising and adjusting the programme in the light of
previous experience. When dispassionately judged by such experience
it will be found that some details of the congress programme
have not achieved the desired success; on the contrary, they have
formed weak links in the main. When these items were undertaken
they evoked a large volume of adverse criticism in the ranks of
Congress workers. Many of them have, no doubt, subordinated
their differences, out of loyalty to the main cause, and quite a large
number, out of their esteem and regard for the personality of the
selfless and saintly promoter of the movement. But, notwithstanding
this admirable display of loyalty among Congress men, the fact
remains and has to be reckoned with, that many items have proved
unsuccessful and perhaps act, in consequence as a clog on the
movement. The soreness, which some of these details have caused,
still remains and is operating to undivide some from others and
makes them lukewarm or unwilling to throw their whole heart
into this movement. If these co-workers of ours could be placated
by a revision of the Congress programme, so that most of the
earnest-minded workers for cause could substantially agree to its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
adoption, it would be a great advantage. And herein perhaps, lay
the chief merit of the amendment moved by Mr. B. C. Pal, which
was rejected by the majority at Calcutta. Taken at its highest,
our success has not gone much beyond what that amendment would
have made possible. It would have had the further advantage of
retaining within our ranks many of our former associates, who
are, at present, either lukewarm or hostile.</p>

<h3>Experiment in youthful sacrifice</h3>

<p>When once the necessity is recognized of revising the programme
in the light of these comments, which are being made throughout
the country, it will not be difficult to find out in what directions
the programme has not achieved the expected success and the reasons
for the same. For instance, the boycott of schools and colleges have
not succeeded and even persons, of known and undoubted loyalty to
the cause, complain that the action of Congress workers has caused
more harm than good. They concentrated too much on the disruption
of existing institutions and less on the creation and maintenance
of new ones on "national" lines. They forgot that a student
cannot be left idle in the street and that, if the Congress must call
him out, it can only be after it has provided for him a good substitute.
In Bombay we let pass the psychological moment when
we could have founded and reared up an excellent college with
various branches. Public enthusiasm was ripe for it in the early
part of the year, but we let it evaporate in declamation and emotional
exaltation. Some went so far as to suggest that it was no
part of the Congress programme to start national Colleges though
the terms of the Congress Resolution specially provided for it.
50000 boys are out in idleness, says Sir Ashutosh Mukherji, some
may glorify in this catastrophe, but there are many who
regard this disruptive event with sad dismay. We have experimented
too much in youthful sacrifice. Our youth have reciprocated
with more love and tenderness than we have shown for
their welfare. The few good institutions which Congress workers
have created, are suffering from our neglect and apathy and
dragging a weary existence. The shadow of a name has, very often
been pursued, to the abandonment of the substance, and we now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
find a large number of boys in the country, who are practically
loafing in the streets, with a vague ambition "to do something
patriotic".</p>

<h3>The Lawyer-Failure</h3>

<p>Our ban on lawyers has, likewise, not attained much success.
Few lawyers, whose sacrifice of their practice has added strength
to the Congress cause, have responded to the call. The prestige of
British court in <i>civil</i> Suits between an <i>Indian and Indian</i> has
not been destroyed and can not be so easily destroyed; for, ordinarily
this variety of legal contests is not much colored with
injustice, as political trials are. If lawyers had been called out,
because, being a trained class of workers, the country wanted their
undivided time and attention at this critical hour, it would have
been a different matter, and, perhaps, if the call had been so made
many, many more would have responded to it. But it was put the
wrong way, and the lawyer was made to appear as if, in pursuing
his profession, he was acting sinfully and must atone for it by a
complete withdrawal from practice. The result was that, out of
sheer self-respect, many really good lawyers have declined to
respond to the call. Many could not give up their practice for
pecuniary reasons and were too honest to adopt subterfuges calculated
to create a semblance of sacrifice. Lawyers have become
"pariahs" of our present political life. Some of them had
borne the brunt of public agitation for more than two decades;
their place is vacant and no class of workers of equal intelligence
and keenness has come forward to take it.</p>

<h3>A Foul Atmosphere</h3>

<p>This part of the Congress programme has created a foul atmosphere
of hypocrisy, intolerance, imposture and conceit in the
Congress Camp, in which modesty, self-respect, and honesty often
time find it hard to hold their place. In our enthusiasm, we forget
that many lawyers value their profession for the training it affords
in courage, truthfulness, honor and toleration. No other profession
trains a young man so well to withstand and expose injustice and to
uphold the tradition of truth and honor. Our past political history
of thirty-three years is a brilliant record of the services rendered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
by lawyers to the Congress cause. If a greater sacrifice than
before was needed now on their part, a direct call on their self-respect
and patriotism on this footing should have been made, but
no good has arisen from putting the lawyer under the ban of
ridicule and infamy. The call made upon them was singularly
harsh. No other class of public workers was required to give up
his means of livelihood. The importing merchant supports British
prestige as much as, if not more than the lawyer and yet he stalks
unabashed in the Congress camp without closing his shop. No ban
was put on litigants, without whom the lawyer cannot thrive. I am
therefore, surprised that notwithstanding so much hardship, so
many lawyers have come out and are to be found in the vanguard of
the movement. The few courts of justice, we called into existence
have not had enough support and are a mockery.</p>

<h3>Revise the Programme</h3>

<p>The failure of these parts of the programme is now
practically admitted and they are now pushed into the background.
It would be better if, in revising the programme in the next Session
of the Congress, these limbs, which have ceased to function or
respond to the laws of our growth, are boldly amputated. In any
event, they make clear the necessity of a revision, so as to render
the programme more effective, elastic and practical.</p>

<h3>Enter the Councils</h3>

<p>The fight requires to be carried on in manifold ways. Some
may carry it in the Councils, face to face with the officials. Why
cannot "Non-Co-operation," in its proper sense, be practised in
the Councils? Sir P. M. Mehta, when he left the Council Hall
with his colleagues on a memorable occasion when he, face to
face with the then home member, mercilessly uncloacked the preposterous
pretensions of the bureaucracy, was fighting with weapons
and a spirit which many Non-Co-operators of the true and
accredited brand may envy in these days. If Non-Co-operation is an
<i>attitude</i> of the mind, as its eminent author conceives it, and not so
much a programme or a creed, a Council Hall is as fitting a place
for its display as a mass meeting in a Marwadi Vidyalaya. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
spirit resides in the mind and is independent of the environment. It
is no ground to say that, often times, the environment frightens a
weakling, for we do not build our doctrines only on the possibility
of men being weak and timid.</p>

<h3>N.C.O. Concession</h3>

<p>We have already departed from the original rigor of our programme
in this behalf. A Non-Co-operator can now compete at
Municipal elections. He can offer advice to Government in or outside
private interviews. Non-co-operator papers do report the proceedings
of the Legislative Bodies, comment on them, and suggest
remedies for the benefit of the Government. Scarcely a non-Co-operator
now-a-days speaks without referring to gubernatorial utterances
and orders in Council. He comments on the policies of
Government, suggesting remedies as he goes on with his comments.
Several lawyers in Bombay, who are still in practice, are now allowed
to occupy prominent places as speakers at Non-Co-operation
meetings. This is as it should be, for we cannot afford to ignore or
despise, in the stinted state as our resources, the co-operation of any
honest workers, prepared to make a sacrifice commensurate with
his capacity. This is all done now silently and as a concession.
My plea is for making the programme so wide, elastic and natural,
as to turn these concessions into acknowledged rights. The Congress
Creed calls upon us to obtain Swaraj by all legitimate and
peaceful means. All weapons, all avenues of work and all manner
of public workers are enjoined on us, for the attainment of the common
end. Why set up ascetic standards, unpractical tests, and unnatural
bans, which may often let in the dishonest but keep out the
honest man, whose co-operation, even with a difference, is often
worth loving. The programme may become theoretically less perfect,
perhaps logically less consistent, but it will certainly be more
natural, real and effective.</p>

<h3>Suggested Modifications</h3>

<p>The exact form of the modification must be left to future discussion.
I would, therefore, suggest as follows:</p>

<p>(1) That foreign propaganda, so summarily put an end to at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
the last Congress, be resumed and if possible extended within proper
bounds. The Indian view has to be put forward before the
civilised world. This is an urgent need of the hour. The Government
are doing it from their own point of view, and we ought to do
the same from ours.</p>

<p>(2) That the time limited be abandoned, for reasons mentioned
in para 25 below.</p>

<p>(3) That the elections to Legislative Bodies, whenever a
chance should occur, should be contested perhaps with the limitation,
that in the Provinces, unless complete autonomy is introduced,
Congressmen should not accept office under the present
system of Government. This may be, if so desired, made conditional
on Government agreeing to dissolve the present Bodies.</p>

<p>(4) A large modification of the educational boycott, including
the total abrogation of the compulsory part of it. Attention
should be concentrated more on the creation of national institutions
than on the withdrawal of students as a set propaganda.
When such institutions are projected, and some of them actually
in existence, and they compete favorably with state aided institutions,
I have no doubt that sufficient impulses have been generated
in the country to secure the exercise of the option in favor
of the former. Side by side with this, an intensive propaganda
should be carried on in the Councils and outside, having for its
object the popularisation of the Universities by a change of the
Act governing them, and also the "nationalisation" of the existing
system of state-aided education, so as to bring it into greater
accord with the present-day requirements and aspirations of the
people. To me, it seems to be such a pity that we have deserted
this avenue of agitation, to be feebly utilised by a few persons in
the present Councils, struggling against an unsuitable environment.
Nine crores, which is nearly the total output on State education,
we are not in a position to despise, and it seems wrong to wait for
this reform till complete Swarajya is attained, which may or may
not be for some time yet. Considerable harm has been done to
the cause of education by the exclusion of this avenue work from
the programme of Congress activities. The fate of primary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
education in the Bombay presidency will clearly illustrate the
point I am making.</p>

<p>(5) A large modification of the ban against lawyers, so as to
admit of several grades of sacrifice from complete abstention from
practice to a giving up of the entirety or a part of the earnings.
A way should be found for getting as many lawyers as possible to
work in this movement provided they are prepared to give the
cause at least a part of their time or money. The Congress ought
to modify its call, so as to make it possible for all honest-minded
lawyers to bear the burden of the country's cause, commensurate
with their capacity to sacrifice.</p>

<p>Similarly, in the matter of conducting defences in British
courts, some curious departure have come to be made from the
strict Congress rule. These departures only indicate that, in its
operation, the rule has been found unpractical and irksome. Congressmen
are not to engage pleaders nor offer a defence with legal
aid. They are simply to make a "statement." A statement is as
much an aid to the administration of justice as a lawyer-made
defence, and in so far, it equally supports the prestige of British
courts. Only, it has the disadvantage of being prolix and unconvincing.
It, therefore, fails of its mark more often than a lawyer's
defence.</p>

<p>Who can urge that the long and interesting statements made
by the Ali Brothers and their co-accused, in the trial at Karachi
were out of place? Yet they had all the features of a lawyer-made
defence, as an aid to the court. The evidence was discussed,
legal objections raised, relevancy commented on and the prosecution
evidence answered. All this assistance was given to the
court, helping it to arrive at truth and justice, precisely in the
same way as a practising lawyer aids judicial administration.</p>

<p>If a statement is permitted, why cannot a lawyer be
employed in Court to make it more convincing and exculpatory?
A statement must be based on facts, and these facts
become material only when proved. On what rational grounds
can, therefore, a statement permitted and yet the material evidence
supporting it disallowed? It is no answer to say that the statement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
is meant for the guidance of the <i>Swaraj</i> Courts when the same are
established, for when that eventuality happens, a statement supported
by evidence will be any a better help to these Swaraj
Courts than a mere statement? It is obvious that no Swaraj
Court will liberate a man merely on his own statement, without
further inquiry.</p>

<h3>Civil Disobedience</h3>

<p>We are on the eve of Mahatma Gandhi undertaking an important
part of his programme by starting Civil Disobedience in a
district in Surat. It is very difficult to offer any useful comment on
this undertaking because beyond the general lines, his programme
in its detail is not yet before the Country. We can only hope that
the resistance to law will not be so undertaken as to be widely
interpreted as a sort of charter for general lawlessness. That
would be a catastrophe for which the country is not prepared.
This seems also to be Mr. Gandhi's opinion, for he has very
prudently circumscribed the practice of the resistance with very
severe restrictions, involving a moral and economic preparation.
To disobey specific orders of Government or their officials, which
have no moral sanction behind them or are illegal in their inception,
is a comparatively easy matter, fraught with no far-reaching
harm to the community. The disobedience, in such a case commands
the moral approval of the civilised community, and ends
only by affecting the prestige of the promulgator of the order.
But when a campaign is undertaken involving a wholesale and
general defiance of order and authority, forces may arise, which,
in the hands of inexperienced and enthusiastic associates or
partisans, may reach extreme limits, involving the community in
chaos, disorder and possibly violence. The country has had only a
year's training in his (Mr. Gandhi) counsels of non-violent resistance&mdash;far
too short a period for his countrymen to imbibe his
spirit, in a manner worthy of his teaching. May we, therefore,
hope that in launching on this undertaking he will seriously consider
this aspect of the case? We shall of course, watch his
experiment but with concern and solicitude, feeling secure in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
hope, created by his magnificent personality, that in his hands the
destinies of the country are perfectly safe.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX VII<br />
    Extracts from the speech delivered by His Excellency Sir Harcourt Butler,<br />
    Governor of the U. P. of Agra &amp; Oudh,<br />
    at the opening of the U. P. Legislative Council,</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Lucknow, 22nd January, 1921</i></p>

<p>Mr. President and Members of the Legislative Council,</p>

<p>"Great efforts have been made to draw away young men from
schools and colleges and to induce professional men to give up
their careers. Great efforts have been made to prevent voters
from going to the polls. But these efforts have met with little
success. The elections have undoubtedly given the province a
really representative legislative council. The chief opponents of
the reforms have shown by word and act that their aim is not the
ordered development of political institutions in India but the
expulsions of Western civilization from India&mdash;a course involving
the reversion to the condition of disorder, lawlessness and internecine
strife such as prevailed in the unsettled times before the
advent of British rule."</p>

<p>"The tenantry were widely stirred up. The criminal classes
took advantage of the occasion and serious trouble ensued in which
there was regrettable loss of life. A full report on the Rae Bareli
disturbances will be published within a few days. It was fortunately
possible to restore order without calling in military aid
from outside, and for this I have already congratulated the local
authorities and others concerned. Statements, I may say that all
reports from both Rae Bareli and Fyzabad indicate that the tenantry
are actuated by no hostility to Government or to Europeans.
The agitators have endeavoured to stir up such hostility."</p>

<p>"As for my Government I have chosen as colleagues without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
favour strong and independent men. They will have my complete
confidence in all matters, and it is my desire that we should work
together as far as possible as one Government. I shall endeavour

    Extracts from the speech delivered by His Excellency Sir Harcourt Butler<br />
    at a meeting of the United Provinces Legislative Council</h2>

<p class="center"><i>28th March 1921</i></p>

<p>Mr. President and Members of the Legislative Council,</p>

<p>"The recent disorder in Rae Bareli has necessitated a further
reconsideration of the question. Whereas the former disorders in
Rae Bareli were largely agrarian in origin the recent disorders
were mainly political in origin and wholly revolutionary".</p>

<p>"The result of the disorders has been an unfortunate loss of
life, for which the agitators are directly responsible, and a feeling
of insecurity which if unchecked may spread with untoward results,
affecting innocent and guilty alike. Confronted with an elemental
question as to the maintenance of order, my Government came
unanimously to the conclusion that it was necessary to stop the
campaign of unconstitutional agitation and lying, <i>propaganda</i>
which has been carried on the four south-eastern districts of Outh&mdash;Rae
Bareli, Partabgarh, Sultanpur and Fyzabad. We therefore
applied to the Government of India to extend the Seditious Meetings
Act to those four districts. This has been done".</p>

<p>"I believe that this action will have the support of this Council
and of responsible people generally in this province. With the
non-co-operators we can have nothing to do beyond meeting their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
mischievous activities. Their movement is a revolutionary movement
playing on passion and pandering to ignorance but the mass
of people are loyal and all their interests are bound up with the
maintenance of order."</p>

<h2>APPENDIX IX<br />
    Extracts from the speech by His Excellency Sir Harcourt Butler<br />
    at a Durbar held at Lucknow</h2>

<p class="center"><i>17th December 1921</i></p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>I am glad to have this opportunity of meeting you to-day, in
formal assembly, and to outline to you the policy of the Government.</p>

<p>My Government was accused some months ago of being
repressive. I have met that charge completely with facts and figures
and proved that the Government has acted with due patience in
spite of deliberate and repeated provocation. It has dealt with
agitation under the ordinary law and has maintained order and
security with reasonable success. Of late the agitators, whose
openly avowed object is to make Government impossible, have
entered on a campaign of increased activity. Quite recently the
Government received reports from several quarters foreshadowing
lawlessness and disorder. The Collector of Meerut reported that
civil disobedience had been openly preached at the District
Congress at Garhmukhtesar, that cloth shops were picketed, that
agitation was plainly on the increase, and that everything looked
like working up to a climax at an early date. The Commissioner
of Fyzabad reported that the situation was menacing in the Bara
Banki district where the Deputy Commissioner could not appear
without being hooted and the loyal section of population were
frightened and disheartened. A speech was delivered in which the
audience was asked by a political fanatic whether they would agree
to murder the Deputy Commissioner and they replied with one
voice that they would. The Commissioner also reported that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
things were menacing in the Tanda sub-division of the Fyzabad
district. At Gonda regular volunteer corps had been instituted with
officers. From Cawnpore and Etawah reports came of a recrudescence
of criminal intimidation. In Ballia the people were asked to
prepare themselves for killing and being killed. Alarming reports
were also received from Saharanpur, Aligarh and Gorakhpur.</p>

<p>Now all these reports reached the Government within three
or four days. It was quite clear that we were on the verge of
serious and widespread trouble. The Government decided, and
decided unanimously, to apply the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act
of 1908, part II, to the whole province at once and to issue instructions
to Commissioners and District Officers to take all measures
under the law necessary for the preservation of order and protection
of loyal and peaceful citizens. This was followed by an open
defiance to the Government signed by over seventy individuals in
the <i>Independent</i> newspaper. As you are aware the ringleaders
have been arrested. I do not propose to deal with individual
cases; some of them are still under trial. I will only say this, that
all the reports I have received from different parts of the province
show that the action taken has had excellent result and has restored
confidence to loyal and peaceful people. Indeed, there is a feeling
of general relief. The Commissioner of Fyazabad reports "There
has been a great improvement since I last wrote. The police who
had resigned are now applying to be taken back." The Commissioner
of Agra writes "The present Government policy appears to
be generally welcomed." The Commissioner of Gorakhpur says
"There is no doubt that the moderate party not only welcome the
arrests but in some cases are jubilant over them." The Commissioner
of Meerut reports that the action taken had "been hailed by
all loyal persons with the greatest relief." He adds "our friends
and the much harried police are in much better hearts and non-co-operator
is no longer looked upon with dread by them." The Commissioner
of Lucknow attributes the settling down of the Hindu
population and especially the cultivating classes largely to the
recent action of Government. A re-assuring report has come from
Aligarh. The situation is still critical; but, I think, that it is well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
in hand, and I am convinced that if a policy of firmness is pursued
and pursued steadily for some time we may reasonably hope to
break the back of a conspiracy which openly avows its intention of
trying to do away with Government and openly defies the law of
the land.</p>

<p>Consider the position, gentlemen; What have the Congress
and <i>Khilafat</i> movements done? <i>Satyagraha</i>, which Mr. Gandhi
himself pronounced to be a "Himalayan blunder" ended in
disgrace. The attempt to boycott colleges and schools failed
signally. It did not affect in this province one per cent of the
students and scholars. The attempt to boycott the law courts was
wholly unsuccessful. The appeal to surrender titles given by and
offices held under the Government fell on deaf ears. The efforts to
seduce soldiers and policemen were almost in vain. But with each
successive failure, they have sown wider the seeds of racial hatred
and the spirit of lawlessness. The results cry out against them and
their work. Their hands are dripping with innocent blood; and the
cries of ruined homes and ravished women have gone up to heaven.
This is the end of the idea of self-Government attained by non-violent
revolution, an idea wholly fantastic and chimerical.</p>

<p>As is usual when Government takes vigorous action, there
is a body of critics who have no experience or sense of government
and who are frightened by action. They seem to think that law
and order keep themselves. The truth is far otherwise. Law and
order are mainly kept by force, and that with difficulty. They
are very easily upset. You have had experience of disorder
in southern Oudh, in which there was an orgy of violence, rape,
rapine and arson. I do not hesitate to tell you that if the
Government trifled with the present situation you would probably
soon find your lives, your property and your honour in danger.
The objection that action has been taken with warning is quite
unfounded. More than once I have publicly declared that this
Government would not tolerate disorder or intimidation. The
aggressors are those who violate the law.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX X<br />
    STATEMENT BY SIR L. PORTER</h2>

<p>We have been vilified bitterly, every kind of abuse has been
showered on us by non-co-operators, every form of insidious
agitation has been tried, and we have stayed our hands.</p>

<h3>Violent Agitators</h3>

<p>I will mention the case of one of the men who has now been
arrested and is undergoing imprisonment as a first-class misdemeanant.
He made at least ten speeches up and down the
country which our legal advisers informed us were clearly actionable.
I allude to Mr. Jawahir Lal Nebru. His final effort was a speech,
somewhere in the west of the Province, in which he quoted word
by word the sedition section, <i>i.e.</i>, the promotion, of disaffection
against the Government as by law established and the section which
deals with promoting hatred between classes of His Majesty's subjects,
and he said that the object of his life was to carry out this
promotion of sedition and disaffection. Still we did nothing. You
may well ask why. We thought that the forces of reason and
sobriety would re-establish their sway. We hoped that the great
body of moderate opinion of the Provinces would be sufficiently
powerful to assuage this movement and to stop the dissemination of
poison. We were wrong. So far from losing any strength I do
not hesitate to say that the movement has gone on gaining strength.
Then came the time in November when we were confronted with
reports from our trusted officers all over the provinces which left
no doubt whatever in our minds that the situation had very greatly
developed, and that there was imminent possibility (I would go
further and say probability) of an outburst of violence in more than
one district. I have here a big folio of reports. It is quite
impossible for me in debate like this to quote them all. There are
copies of reports from districts as wide apart and representative as
Meerut, Cawnpur, Fyzabad, Etawah, Balia, Barabanki and the
peaceful district of Aligarh, which, according to its member,
Thakur Manak Singh, is now the scene of this campaign of repression.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
I should like, as a typical instance, to read out the description
of the procedure which was adopted in the Barabanki district.
The Barabanki district, as my friend on my right will bear me out,
is a particularly difficult one. It is full of a class whom religious
fanaticism particularly affects and when it once gets out of hand it
is very difficult to deal with. I remember when I first came to
India, there was tremendous outbreak of dacoity and violent crime
in that and adjacent districts, which it took months to put down, at
the cost of immense suffering to the population. This is one of the
districts, which was selected as a focus in work on by these (what
should I call them?) advocates of soul force.</p>

<h3>Soul Force</h3>

<p>Their main activities were directed to stirring up religious
fanaticism. In mosques, in bazars mendacious stories were told
regarding the bombardment and desecration of the Sacred Places of
Islam. They were told that Hindu and Mahomedan women had
been outraged and that medicines issued from dispensaries were
mixed with wine and that the fat of cows and pigs was used in the
manufacture of cloth. There was boycott and intimidation to prevent
foreign cloth sellers from importing any more cloth, and to
force them to sign a pledge not to do so. This went on until
November and the beginning of December when the picketing of
schools started. That is a typical report from a district which
takes very little to set it ablaze. What has recently happened there
you have already read in the papers. There are many other
instances which strike me, but there is one typical instance from
Etawah. There is a fair which has been held there for many years.
It was picketed. People were prevented from coming in by open
intimidation and finally attempts were made to blacken the face of
a Maulvi on his way to the Islamia High School, of which he is
manager. I can multiply these instances, and, if any member of
the Council wishes to know the representations which were received
from these districts, I am perfectly willing to let him see the reports
in order that he may satisfy himself as to what the real condition
was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
Pandit Radha Kant Malviya: Will the Hon. Member read
the report from Allahabad.</p>

<p>Sir Ludovic Porter: We had a report from the Commissioner
of Allahabad, on whose judgment I place great reliance, just before
we enforced this Act. He expressed his reasoned opinion that if
we allowed matters to drift any further, there would be a widespread
disaster. He also stated that from information he had
received, the whole camp of non-co-operators, in Allahabad were
particularly cheerful with regard to the outlook, and they thought
great developments in their favour were shortly going to take
place. Well that was our position. As to the nature of this non-violent
non-co-operation, we had no delusions.</p>

<h3>Criminal Intimidation</h3>

<p>We know that criminal intimidation had been practised on the
widest scale in many districts. I may say that the majority of
districts where these associations existed, criminal intimidation of
a subtle kind, namely to attack a man in his religious opinions or
to attack him in his social relations, had been widely practised.
We had an example here in Lucknow of ordinary intimidation. A
member of the Council himself witnessed the unfortunate driver
of an ekka being dragged off his ekka and beaten because he
ventured to ply for hire on the 17th of November.</p>

<p>I know myself the case of a shop which was kept open for two
or three days. The shopkeeper was surrounded by a howling
mob, and he was told what would happen to him, if he did not
shut up his shop. In Fatehpur they kept a blackboard, which was
exhibited publicly, to show up the people, who ventured to buy
foreign cloth. This is also a form of subtle and most cruel intimidation
involving social boycott. You all know perfectly well the
difficulties that exist in India in getting victims of this kind of
tyranny to come forward and seek their legal redress in the ordinary
courts of law. The difficulty of proving criminal intimidation
is accentuated by the fact that it is not cognizable by the police,
and, consequently the complainant has to go to court, but, owing
to the difficulty of getting witnesses to prove his case, he usually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
compromises. Well that is the position which confronted us.
There was a system of widespread intimidation. So far from the
movement being on the verge of collapse, as certain optimists
stated to-day, it was increasing in vigour. There was the usual lip
service of non-violence, a profession which in me produces a feeling
of nausea. Practice and precept, as we said in a letter to the
Government of India, which they quoted in the debate "were poles
as under." There were also, as my friend Kunwar Jagdish
Parshad in his eloquent speech this morning has stated, constant
endeavours to seduce Government servants from their duty. A
great deal of pity has been showered on the non-co-operators by
certain speakers to-day, but they never spared a moment to think
what the police have gone through. Here in Lucknow Chauk,
sub-inspectors and the rank and file of your own fellow countrymen
have been grossly insulted, abused and their family life
rendered intolerable. Are we not going to support them when
such facts are brought to our notice? We are bound to support
our loyal servants, who, through all these troubles, have served us
faithfully. I am only asking for some recognition of the difficulty
to which they are exposed in performing their duties, and in their
daily life. With these facts before us we came to the conclusion&mdash;the
Government as a whole came to the conclusion&mdash;that the
Criminal Law Amendment should be extended to these Provinces.
I think there can be no doubt that the whole Council are unanimous
that law and order must be enforced. They may differ from
us as to the method which we took.</p>

<h3>The Arrests</h3>

<p>I now come to the arrests which followed. The great
majority of arrests were effected by the local authorities under the
powers delegated to them. In one instance only so far as my
memory serves, the Governor-in-Council issued orders for certain
arrests, and that was for the leaders of Allahabad and Lucknow.
What are the facts in regard to these particular arrests?
These associations had been declared to be illegal. Immediately
after their proclamation a manifesto was published on
the 6th December with a pledge which was signed by 75 persons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
I will read the terms of that manifesto. "Having read and
thoroughly understood the Government notification, etc., and knowing
full well the consequences of not obeying them, we, etc., hereby
pledge ourselves civilly to disobey without any objection all such
Government orders and laws as may be determined from time to
time by the Provincial Congress Committee, or by a committee
appointed by or in this behalf. We further pledge ourselves to
obey, in utter disregard of the consequences, all orders of the
volunteer corps relating to such disobedience." Now gentlemen,
what does that mean? It means that at the bidding of an irresponsible
autocrat in Bombay, the members of this association
pledged themselves blindly to disobey any law of the land. If that
is not the essence of anarchy I do not know what is. We were told
this morning in the very moderate speech of my friend Mr. Zafar
Husain, that he did not think that this Act was enacted with a view
to the present juncture. Of course it was not. Nobody could
forsee this madness which has come over India during the last two
years. It was enacted to meet an outbreak of anarchy in Bengal.
Could there be anything worse than the present position, that a
body of men numbering thousands, totally irresponsible, very many
of them now of a dangerous character, (not at first, but they are
steadily deteriorating) pledge themselves to disobey any law when
they were asked to do so by a gentlemen in Bombay, for this is what
this pledge means? How could any Government carry on, that
would not accept that challenge? In consequence of this, we issued
orders for the arrest and production of a certain number, not all,
of the leaders. In doing so we have now the support and authority
of the Government of India. The Government has informed us that
they agree with us in holding that the persons who deliberately
organise associations, avowedly intended to break the law, or
associations the members of which are pledged blindly to disobey
any laws, are liable to criminal prosecution. Following on that
came the meeting at Allahabad, at which the Superintendent
of Police, who had been deputed to execute a search warrant, was
present. This meeting deliberately reaffirmed this pledge in his
presence. Now, I think if we analyse the objections that have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
been taken to the prosecutions they very largely centre round those
persons, the leaders and members of this meeting, who have been
prosecuted and convicted. In all they number, I, think, something
like 100. I have stated the facts, and I accept the responsibility.
I see no other way out. As long as any Government exists they
have to deal with men who offer a challenge like that, in the
method in which we did.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX XI<br />
    BARABANKI DISORDERS</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Lucknow, 18th January</i></p>

<p>In a view of the various rumours that were current regarding
the situation at Barabanki....</p>

<p>A lengthy official communique has just now been issued based
on the report of the Deputy Commissioner....</p>

<p>At the same time, with effect from the 23rd November 1921
the Criminal Law Amendment Act was applied to the Province. Its
immediate effect was good, and several volunteers who had been
parading in uniform doffed their sashes and were disbanded.</p>

<h3>Khilafat Agitators</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, however, Khilafat agitators, who had publicly
announced in the press of the 18th November that Barabanki Tahsil
was being prepared for civil disobedience by the end of November,
considered this act a suitable one to infringe. They redoubled
their efforts and collected considerable sums, mainly for the
Angora Fund, both through members of the 46 Khilafat committees
established in this district and by itinery volunteers, who were
paid for their services, either by fixed monthly salaries or by a
percentage on collections. Between the 19th and 24th December,
four volunteers were arrested under Section 7 (1) and 17 (2) of the
Act, and these arrests were reported to have had a temporary
beneficial effect. By the 3rd January, when the District delegates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
returned from the Ahmedabad conference, the leaders decided to
take action openly. On the 4th it was reported to me that large
numbers of volunteers would march into the city under the command
of their zemindar leaders. No precise information however,
could be obtained as to their intentions. On the morning of the
7th January batches of volunteers began to issue chiefly from the
Congress Office from which was hung a Khilafat flag and a large
notice calling on people to enlist as volunteers. These volunteers
were mostly from outside villages and were headed by petty zemindars.
They were all Mahomedans and had been worked up to a
high pitch of religious enthusiasm. Many of them had their
Qurans slung round their necks. They had apparently been incited
to a state bordering on religious frenzy by exhortations from
their leaders, that their religion was being destroyed by the British
Government. They were wild in their abuse of Government,
officials and specially the Police. The whole religious street in
front of the Congress office resounded with religious shouts and
cries of "Victory to Islam". The cry of "Allah ho Akbar" was
uttered as a war cry with fanatical zeal, specially when any arrests
were made.</p>

<h3>The Arrests</h3>

<p>I had deputed Mr. Colton, Superintendent of Police, and Babu
Ambikanandan Singh, Sub-Divisional Officer to take up a position
opposite the Congress office and to arrest the ring leaders and the
most truculent of the volunteers as it did not appear to be safe to
allow them to remain at large, specially as fresh volunteers continued
to pour into the city. Those selected were marched down
under an escort to the Jail....</p>

<p>The procession was accompanied by noisy music and the usual
shouts of non-co-operation were raised. He (Chaudhari Athar
Ali) refused to go before the Deputy Magistrate as requested but
mounting the steps of the Congress office delivered a speech. After
reciting certain words from the Qoran he addressed the crowd,
and in a loud voice, declared that this tyrannical Government or
tyrannical race (both versions are given) should be destroyed. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
crowd, which was in a state of fanatical frenzy, replied, "<i>Amin</i>,
it will be destroyed immediately". He exhorted the crowd to
"become volunteers, enrol volunteers and fill the jails&mdash;victory to
Islam". The cry was taken up by the crowd. Seeing that the
speech was causing great excitement, the Deputy Magistrate directed
the police to produce him before him. He refused to go to the
jail in the <i>Ekka</i> provided by the Deputy Magistrate, but insisted
on going on foot, taking a circuitous route at the head of the procession
of 500 or 1,000 men. He stopped the procession at various
places and at these halts the usual <i>jais</i> were raised. The police
were abused and Government servants were called dogs and pigs.
On this day ten volunteers were arrested. On this date also there
was the same commotion in the city, but the number of volunteers
decreased.</p>

<p>Throughout the four days the volunteers created disturbances.
It was obvious that the movement was entirely a Mahomedan one.
Not a single Hindu volunteer appeared. The Mahomedan volunteers
and the crowd which cheered them on were filled with religious
enthusiasm and hatred of the British Government. The intention
of their leaders apparently, was to provoke the Police to acts
of violence against them, and also to prove that they could insult
the Government official with impunity, and were not afraid to go to
jail. The following remark made in jail by Nawab Ali, an
ex-vakil, a few minutes after his sentence, in the presence of two
magistrates and a large number of pleaders, is significant. "By
imprisonment people would get accustomed to the horrors of jail.
By shooting they would learn to bare their breasts to rifle shots
and bayonets. Men ready to be shot should now be enlisted."
The accused have been convicted.&mdash;<i>The Pioneer January 20,

<h2>APPENDIX XII<br />
    THE GORAKHPUR TRAGEDY</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Gorakhpur, 7th February</i></p>

<p>From early morning on Saturday a large number of volunteers
were noticed arriving at Chauri Chaura and collecting on the
Gorakhpur side of the railway station. They then proceeded
towards the Bhapa Bazar, and formed a procession. They said
that they were going to picket the bazar, and they proceeded
towards the bazar through the police station grounds, although
this was not their direct route. The procession consisted roughly
of 3,000 people, and was headed by four or five volunteers in
khaddar uniform. Some of them had swaraj flags in their hands.
After the main body of the procession had gone on, there were a
few stragglers with whom the police, it is alleged, had some
interchange of remarks. It is also stated that one or two of the
stragglers were hustled by some of the chowkidars.</p>

<h3>The Mob breaks Loose</h3>

<p>It is impossible to say exactly what happened next but at any
rate the stragglers shouted out and main procession came back
and started throwing kanker at the Police. For some time the
attack was confined to vicious kanker throwing, in which thousands
of volunteers were engaged. The sub-inspector, finding that the
affair was taking a more serious turn, asked the rioters to desist,
but they would not take any heed, and attacked the police with
lathies. The sub-inspector, in order to frighten the mob, fired a
few shots in the air. This infuriated the mob, who made a rush
towards the thana with lathies and spears. A few policemen were
knocked down, and the remainder of the police went inside the
thana buildings for protection. One or two policemen must have
fired on the mob in earnest, as some of the rioters had received
gunshot wounds, but whether the firing took place before the rush
or after it is not known yet. By this time several of the policemen
had been killed outside the police buildings, and one party fetched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
oil and straw and set fire to the thana at various points. This
drove the entire police force out of the buildings.</p>

<p>They were immediately set upon by the mob and done to death
in the most brutal manner. Their heads were battered with hinges
torn from the doors of the thana, and then the bodies were soaked
in oil and burnt. The charred remains were recovered, some in
front of the thana, others in the thana compound and one at the
back of the thana. Some of the armed policemen had obviously
been battered to death by their own muskets. There was a certain
amount of money in the thana and it is suspected that the rioters,
having killed the policemen, looted the thana and then set fire to
the buildings. The sub-Inspector's family quarters, it is believed,
were also looted, and cash and jewellery were removed, but the
inmates were not interfered with. The family quarters also bear
marks of violence. The windows have been removed, and there
are wide apertures in the roof. After having completely destroyed
the police station the rioters dismantled the railway line in two
places, and cut the telegraph wires. They threatened to kill the
railway station master and the post master of Chauri Chaura if they
sent any messages to the authorities at Gorakhpur. In all 22
policemen, including two Sub Inspectors, one head constable, 15
constables, four chowkidars and a servant of the Sub-Inspector were
killed. Among the dead were found two of the rioters. A constable,
and a chowkidar, who were at the police station during the attack
escaped, and these men have been traced, and it is believed that
their statement will throw considerable light on the whole affair.
Complete quiet has now been restored. The Commissioner, the
Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police visited the scene
immediately on receipt of information, and restored confidence
among the village people and the railway and telegraph lines were
quickly repaired. Mr. Sands, the Deputy Inspector General of
Police, attended the funeral of the dead policemen. The authorities
immediately after the incident, invited three prominent gentlemen
of Gorakhpur, one of whom is a non-co-operator, to visit the
scene of the tragedy.&mdash;<i>The Pioneer February 9, 1922.</i></p>

    BENGAL</h2>

<h3>His Excellency's Speech at the St. Andrew's Day
Dinner, on 30th November 1920</h3>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>Among other things non-co-operation is to achieve is swaraj in
one year. Mr. Gandhi has said so himself. The question is&mdash;do
the people of Bengal want this particular form of swaraj? Being
a shrewd and intelligent people they will doubtless wish to satisfy
themselves first of all as to what precisely this swaraj is. Fortunately
we are able to answer that question with authority, because
Mr. Gandhi had issued a very clear explanation of what he means
by swaraj in a small manual entitled 'Indian Home Rule', a new
edition of which was published by Messrs. Ganesh &amp; Co., of
Madras, last year. I earnestly commend a perusal of it to all who
are interested in the future of the land we live in....</p>

<p>Very well, if this is the sort of thing that people want by all
means let them adopt non-co-operation. But I do not believe for a
moment that this is what people want. And that, no doubt, is why
we find so many other reasons advanced for adopting non-co-operation.
It is claimed for it for example, that it is a saintly
weapon in the hands of an oppressed people engaged in a righteous
struggle against a tyrannous and unrighteous Government. Let us
examine its credentials so that we may see to what extent the claim
to righteousness can be sustained. In its earliest phase, when it
was known as <i>Satyagraha</i>, its result were admittedly evil. The
Hunter Committee was unanimous in its opinion that its effect was
to engender "a familiarity and sympathy with disobedience to
laws" and "to undermine the law abiding instincts which stand
between society and outbreaks of violence at a time when their full
strength was required." And, indeed, Mr. Gandhi himself confessed
himself sorry that when he embarked upon a mass movement
"he under-rated the forces of evil, and that he was obliged
to pause and consider how best to meet the situation." Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
again another object of the non-co-operators is to re-impose Turkish
Administration upon the non-Turkish peoples who have so
long suffered under it. The fact that under Turkish administration
calculated attempts have been made to exterminate the
Armenian people&mdash;one of the most horrible chapters in the whole
history of crime&mdash;is ignored, a matter for surprise, surely, in view
of the innate abhorrence of violence professed by the originator of
the movement. Indeed, any one making a comprehensive survey
of the non-co-operation movement could scarcely be blamed if he
came to the conclusion that the only password required to give
admission to the non-co-operation camp was "race-hatred." And
is Bengal going to tolerate a movement based upon hatred, and,
therefore, rooted in evil? Surely the world has had its fill of
hatred. Cast your eyes over the past six years, and what do you
see? A world in agony. The peoples of this earth trailing their
spectral way across a blood-soaked scene of destruction and desolation&mdash;a
ghastly phantasmagoria of human suffering; a hideous
calvary. Humanity in torment, scourged with sorrow, losing its
hold upon hope, drifting derelict in a terrifying ocean of despair.
That is what hatred has done for mankind. And is mankind going
to tolerate those who would deliberately and of malice
aforethought perpetuate this grisly tradition of hatred
among men? Let us have the answer of the people of
this country to that question. For myself I have faith in
the better mind of the people of Bengal. Not for nothing
did Job Charnock lay the foundations of this great city. The
finger of destiny was even then tracing the future of Great Britain
and India upon the rock of doom. For better or for worse our
paths lie side by side. The policy of Great Britain has been fairly
and frankly stated. We are inviting the people of India to co-operate
with us in making and travelling over that road which will
lead to an India fashioned in so far as its internal affairs are concerned
in ever-increasing accordance with the genius of its peoples,
and filling a position of ever increasing pride and honour in the great
confederation of the British Empire. Can any one who has faith
in the existence of an eternal and immutable principle of justice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
and right doubt what the final choice of the people of India will
be? Surely not. And it is with an unshakeable faith in its future
that I give you the toast of "The Land We Live in."</p>

<h3>His Excellency's Speech at the St. Andrew's
Dinner, on 30th November 1921</h3>

<p>India to-day is honoured by another distinguished guest&mdash;the
most distinguished, indeed save only one, whom the citizens of the
British Empire could welcome, namely, the heir to the Empire's
Throne&mdash;His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. He has come
with words of sympathy upon his lips and with feelings of affection
in his heart for the "Land we live in." Can it be doubted, then
that from all communities and all creeds he will receive a royal
welcome? I confess that it was with amazement that I learned
that there was a small section of people, in this land of all lands,
who had so far forgotten the dictates of courtesy as to urge the
boycott of the Royal visitor. The promoters of this movement
claim, I believe, to represent the fine flower of the ancient culture
and civilisation of India. Well one lives and learns. I had always
been brought up to believe that courtesy towards a guest was a
deep-rooted tradition with the Indian people. And so I still
believe it to be, though there may be some who have forgotten it.
I do not believe that this attitude represents the real mind of India.
Indeed, I know that it does not&mdash;for it was an Indian gentleman
whose patriotism is beyond all possible question, who said to me
when he read of the proposal "now must we bow our heads in
shame for in showing rudeness to a guest we have touched the
lowest depths of national humiliation and degradation." That, I
believe, represents the best and, indeed, the real mind of India, for
in India it has always been realised that discourtesy injures those
who are guilty of it rather than those against whom it is practised,
for it lowers them in the eyes of all right thinking men and indeed
is sooner or later found by the man who is guilty of it to be a
wound gnawing at his own self-respect...</p>

<p>Already long strides have been taken along the path towards
the ultimate goal. Indian and European have come closer together&mdash;mutual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
understanding and goodwill are springing up between
them. How much more could be achieved in this direction were
it not for the black cloud of anger and hatred which has been
brought into being by the apostles of revolution. From my experience
of the past 12 months I have no hesitation in saying that
a wonderful new era would have dawned for India already, had it
not been for the wild passions which have been let loose upon the
land by those who have pinned their faith to revolution.</p>

<p>They call the Government "Satanic". Have they then a
monopoly of righteousness? The wild lawlessness and bloodshed
at Giridih, Malegaon, Alighar, Malabar, Bombay and many other
places&mdash;do these things not savour of the work of Satan? These
are, indeed, but the heralds of red revolution. Let them look deep
into their hearts and ask themselves in all seriousness if the salvation
of India lies along such lines....</p>

<p>His Excellency replying to the deputation of the representation
of the people in the mufassal, held in Government House
Calcutta on 2nd July 1921, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>Let me, therefore, repeat what I said a year ago. The facts
are these: The Turkish troops in the fort at Mecca, in their
attempts to overcome the Arabs who had rallied round the Sheriff
bombarded the mosque containing the Kaaba. One of the Turkish
shells actually struck the Kaaba, burned a hole in the holy carpet
and killed nine persons who were kneeling in prayer. These are
the facts. The outrage was committed by the Turks, and I solemnly
and categorically affirm that the British had nothing whatsoever to
do with it. This being so, can you or any one suggest any other
motive for the propagation of such falsehoods except the desire to
create hatred against the British?...</p>

<h3>His Excellency's speech at the Legislative
Council on 19th December 1921</h3>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>I will not go further back than October last. At the beginning
of that month a manifesto, signed by Mr. Gandhi and a large
number of other prominent non-co-operators, laid it down that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
was the duty of every Indian soldier and Civilian to sever his connection
with Government. There followed two important developments&mdash;an
intensive campaign to undermine the loyalty of the
police and a rapid development in the activities of "volunteer"
corps. Alongside of these two significant developments was to be
observed a rapid increase in open lawlessness and defiance of
constituted authority. There were breaches of the peace in
Howrah and Calcutta which are within the recollection of all.
But such episodes were not confined to Calcutta. All over the
Presidency persons were moving, stirring up dissatisfaction among the
masses. This process was assisted by an intensive campaign of
highly inflammatory speeches which had been in progress for some
months past. Between the beginning of June and the middle of
November, I received reports of no less than 4,265 meetings held in
different parts of the province. I could quote passages from these
speeches which are so inflammatory, so violent in their abuse that
they would shock the Council. I refrain from doing so for the sole
reason that I do not want to excite feeling unnecessarily. But I
can assure the Council that, addressed, as in nine cases out of ten
these speeches have been, to audiences made up of the illiterate
and emotional masses, they could have but one result, namely that
of spreading broadcast feelings of hatred and disaffection and of
goading the people to violence. And that, indeed, has already been
the actual result. Assaults on Settlement Officers have taken place.
Government servants have been threatened and boycotted. Now let
me return to Calcutta; and I take the events of November 17th to
illustrate the state of affairs which had been reached. The life of
city was paralysed. Were the police provocative? Certainly not.
On the contrary the almost universal complaint made to me was
that the police remained inactive and refrained from making arrests.</p>

<p class="gap-above">I have now to inform the Council of the discovery on the night
of December 8th of a number of sinister weapons concealed in an
untenanted house in the heart of the town. The nature of these
weapons left little doubt as to the sort of use to which they were
intended to be put&mdash;swords ingeniously concealed in the handles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
of umbrellas, daggers of a peculiarly vicious type, tulwars and jars
of acid. Very well, then I would lay stress upon this&mdash;that with so
many recent outbreaks of rioting in the streets of the city fresh in
one's mind, and with these further evidences of the sort of activities
which were in progress at the movement, it was not unreasonable
as a precautionary measure to have recourse to a limited number
of military patrols.</p>

<p>Only three days ago an Urdu manuscript leaflet was found posted
up in the city of which the following is a translation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about only? Just come face to face
with your opponent. Let yourself be cut to pieces, even to death
but do not let any loss come to the Khilafat. Do not look towards
Bagdad, neither do you look towards the Army, but kill your enemy
right and left. Do not let any of your enemy to be left unkilled if
you see him, and do not think that you are alone, because you are
being helped by Imam Mehdi, who is standing in front of you. Call
him, just fly a flag in your hand and cry out Khoda, Khoda, beat
a drum in the name of Din Muhammad throughout the lanes."</p>

<h2>APPENDIX XIV<br />
    Governor's Warning</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Calcutta, February 11</i></p>

<p>Speaking at the Trades Association dinner in Calcutta, Lord
Ronaldshay, the Governor of Bengal, made a lengthy reference to
the political outlook.</p>

<p>It would be the height of unwisdom, said His Excellency, to
close one's eyes to the gravity of the situation with which not only
the Government but society in the widest meaning of that term is
now faced. It seems desirable to call attention to this because
there still appear to be quite a number of people who in spite of all
that has happened, in spite of the resort to violence which has
characterised the Non-co-operation movement in Malabar, Malegaon,
Giridih. Aligarh, Bombay and many other places have not
yet grasped the seriousness or the nearness of the danger, with
which the country is threatened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
Take the case of the Non-co-operation volunteers. We are
told by some that we ought to withdraw our notification under the
Act of 1908 declaring these volunteer corps to be unlawful association.
A recommendation to that effect has quite recently been
made to the Government by the Legislative Council. It is true
that under the existing constitution, we are still responsible to
Parliament for the maintenance of law and order and though it
would no doubt save us much trouble and anxiety if we were able
to transfer the responsibility from our own shoulders to those of
the Legislative Council, we cannot do so. Nevertheless I have
always regarded it as my duty to consider with the utmost care any
recommendations which the Council makes and in this case I am
calling for special reports as to the nature and extent of the present
activities of these volunteers in different parts of the province in
order that I may have the fullest and most up-to-date information
before me.</p>

<h3>On the Defensive</h3>

<p>In considering the matter in the meanwhile, I would point out
to the public at large something which, judging by the criticism to
which we are subjected, had been overlooked, namely, that from
the very beginning of the Non-co-operation movement right up to
the present time, the Government have been on the defensive. It
is the Non-co-operators who have always attacked and by so doing
have compelled the Government to take up weapons for its defence.</p>

<p>For example I have heard it suggested that the Government
have goaded the Non-co-operators into Civil Disobedience by the
measures which they have recently taken. Nothing could be further
from the truth. The policy of civil disobedience was accepted
by the All-India Congress Committee at the beginning of November
and it was not until towards the end of that month that action
against the volunteers was taken. Mr. Gandhi himself, in moving
the civil disobedience resolution on November 4th defined civil disobedience
as a civil revolution, which, wherever practised would
mean the end of the Government's authority and open defiance of
the Government and its laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
Well, that seems to be explicit enough and it seems a little
unreasonable, surely, that those who profess to be opposed to such
a revolution, should seriously urge the Government to lay aside the
weapons, which it has only taken up to protect itself against, to use
Mr. Gandhi's words once more "the destruction of its authority
and the open defiance of its laws". Do those who object to these
volunteer-corps being declared to be unlawful associations realise
what these corps have been brought into existence for? They
have no excuse for not knowing, because Mr. Gandhi has himself
explained quite frankly the object, for which they are being recruited.
He declared at the conference held in Bombay on January 14th
that, even if a round table conference was to be held he would not
stop the enlistment of volunteers for a single moment. Why, because
the enlistment was a preparation for civil disobedience.</p>

<h3>The Critics Answered</h3>

<p>There can be no doubt on that point at all, for we have also
the letter written by Pandit Kunzru to Mr. Jinnah, in which he
states that Mr. Gandhi declared explicitly at the conference that
the enrolment and training of volunteers for starting civil disobedience
must be continued. Very well then, what we are asked to
do is this: To declare that the volunteer corps enrolled and
trained for civil disobedience are lawful associations. Do those who
urge us to take this step regard civil disobedience as a lawful form
of political activity? If they do not, by what process of reasoning,
do they argue that the agency by which civil disobedience is to be
carried out should be declared by Government to be a lawful
agency?</p>

<p>Now let us consider for a moment what the Non-co-operators
mean by civil disobedience in its most developed form. It has been
explained by Mr. Dip Narayan Singh a leading Non-co-operator of
Behar. The procedure is to be as follows;&mdash;The chief civil officer
in the area selected for its operation is to be given seven days to
hand over the district to the Non-co-operators. The residents in
the area are then to be ordered to disobey all the orders and laws
of the Government and to refuse to pay taxes, register documents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
and so on. At the same time the police station and courts are to be
surrounded and the officials to be told to deposit their uniforms and
other badges of office. The police stations and courts will then be
treated as Swaraj property.</p>

<p>You well see that this bears out to the full declaration made
by Mr. Gandhi, in moving the civil disobedience resolution at
the meeting of the All-India Congress Committee on November
4th, that his programme of civil disobedience constitutes a civil
revolution, which, wherever practised, will mean the end of the
Government's authority and the open defiance of Government and
its laws. Again I would ask, to those who wish these volunteers to
be declared to be lawful wish to see this programme put into
operation without a resort to violence, which will drench the country
in blood?</p>

<h3>The Lesson of Chauri Chaura</h3>

<p>Even the milder forms of Non-co-operation activity such as
picketing,&mdash;which is often claimed by the Non-co-operators to be
peaceful pastime though even this claim is no longer maintained by
Mr. Gandhi as I shall show in a moment&mdash;result in wild orgies of
violence as we have been painfully reminded again, within the last
few days by the horrible crime at Chauri Chaura in the United
Provinces. This outbreak, in which 21 police men and chaukidars
were violently beaten to death was deliberately organised, we are
told, in the report from the Commissioners, by the volunteers, and
if picketing results in orgies of murder and destruction of this kind
what are likely to be results of attempts to put into operation the
full pledged programme of Civil Disobedience to which I have
already referred?</p>

<p>But it seems, as I have already remarked that Mr. Gandhi no
longer maintains that all picketing is peaceful, for writing in his
newspaper, "Young India" a short time ago, he says that in connection
with the proposal for a round table conference his suggestion
was that all picketing, except bona-fide peaceful picketing should
be suspended pending the result of the conference. Clearly then, in
Mr. Gandhi's opinion picketing is of two kinds, bona fide peaceful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
picketing on the one hand, and picketing which is not bona fide and
peaceful on the other. Very well then, Mr. Gandhi knows that
picketing is not peaceful. He must know that the more drastic
forms of civil disobedience, which he is now determined to embark
upon, must lead to violence.</p>

<h3>The Issue</h3>

<p>Is it possible under these circumstances to come to any conclusion
other than that reached by the Government of India, that
the issue is no longer between this or that programme of political
advance, but between lawlessness and all its dangerous consequences
on the one hand, and on the other hand, the maintenance of
those principles, which lie at the root of civilised Governments.</p>

<p>In Bengal civil disobedience has already taken the form in a
number of districts of a refusal to pay the "chaukidari" tax, and I
have already received complaints from landholders that tenants are
refusing to pay their rent throughout the province.</p>

<p>A general spirit of contempt for authority and defiance of law
and order is being fostered. Well, respect for lawful authority
and a general willingness on the part of the people to observe the
law are the pillars upon which the very existence of society rests.
If these be cut away, society fall into the abyss of anarchy and is
shattered. It is recorded of a famous figure in history that he
fiddled while Rome was burning. The story is one which is not
without its moral for the present day.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX XV<br />
    Extracts from the speech of the Hon'ble Sir Henry
    Wheeler, Member in charge of Political Department</h2>

<p>What is the situation with which we are faced? It is the
outcome of a movement which, in pursuit of certain political aims,
has resulted in every province in India in bloodshed, disorder and
confusion. A concise picture of the all India situation is contained
in the report of the committee which recently inquired into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
working of certain laws at Simla, and from it I quote their conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<p>Taking into consideration all the evidence we have received
and the points to which we have adverted and bearing in mind the
still prevailing economic discontent, we cannot dismiss as improbable
the danger of sudden sectarian, agrarian or labour disorder on
a large scale culminating in riots.</p>

<p>They give instances of what they call 34 notable cases of disorder
which have occurred in India during the current year. That
is, most briefly, the position in India as a whole.</p>

<p>Let me now give a few illustrations of the position in Bengal,
with which we are more particularly concerned, for it is perhaps
apt to be overlooked that the whole problem does not centre round
Calcutta alone. There is outside this city this vast Presidency of
40 millions people, and the difficulties in the <i>mufussal</i> are just as
acute as here. To cite an example&mdash;in the district of Rangpur we
have lately had reported an organisation of volunteers under a
district captain and four vice-captains, definitely named, supported
by two subordinate officers in each thana and a regular budget and
funds, which, in addition to the better known objects of the non-co-operation
movement, had set before itself the following five aims.&mdash;</p>

<ol>

 <li>The organisation of volunteers to be ready for civil disobedience;</li>

 <li>the preparation of the people to abstain from payment of chaukidari
 and union board tax;</li>

 <li>the preparation of the tenants to refrain from paying rents;</li>

 <li>the preparation of the people to boycott the thana and the law courts;</li>

 <li>to boycott higher grade police and other officers especially with
 regard to foodstuffs, and if as a result of this the Government start
 their own store and make local arrangements it is felt that it will be
 possible to place difficulties in the way of transport.</li>

</ol>

<p>This last line has in fact been taken and the Collector had to
improvise supplies of food to various thanas and registration office.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
The Council will have noticed the use of the term "civil disobedience,"
and in two other districts&mdash;namely, Noakhali and Faridpur&mdash;we
have had the usual phenomena of a little knot of men forming
themselves into a committee and saying: "We will have civil disobedience."
What is civil disobedience understood to mean?
Lest it be thought that it is merely an abstract subject for discussion,
say, in a newspaper article, let me refer to an interesting definition of
the term which we have recently had from a neighbouring province.
The president of a meeting there lately outlined civil disobedience
in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>A notice calling upon Government to grant Swaraj within
seven days will first be served upon the chief civil officer present
in the locality selected for civil disobedience. Subsequently
the residents of the particular locality will be directed to disobey
all orders and laws of Government and to refuse to pay taxes,
register documents, etc. At the same time police stations and
courts will be surrounded and the officials told to deposit their
uniforms and other badges of office. Thereafter police-stations
and courts will be treated as Swaraj property. That is a position
which, I put in to the Council, can be summed up in one word,
"anarchy." That is the civil disobedience which is being preached,
and which, if we are to believe the three speeches which we have
just heard, is a little excitement which, in the words of one speaker,
can be disposed of by a "flick of a handkerchief."</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I could carry on these examples from the
<i>mufassal</i> to Chittagon, which has been in a state of disturbance
and agitation since April last, and to Howrah where disturbances
have been intermittent throughout the year, culminating in firing in
the streets and in the death of a policeman. But the chronicle
is too long, and I pass to Calcutta, where the remarks of His
Excellency have fortunately shortened my task. We are all aware
that the incessant stream of inflammatory oratory and agitation
in Calcutta culminated on the 17th November in a paralysis of the
life of the city and I was even surprised, when refreshing
my memory as to those events, to see how openly what was done
was gloried in by the leaders of the non-co-operation movement as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
having been done by their orders and direction. They were good
enough to define in their instructions who might go about the
streets and who might not, I have seen the statement that by the
kindness of the Congress and the Khilafat committees certain
shops would be allowed to open at 12 noon. There has never been
any attempt to conceal the fact that the town was at that time,
in the view of the non-co-operators, subject to their orders&mdash;subject
by the processes of intimidation with which we are well acquainted.</p>

<p>Now if that was the position&mdash;and I submit that this is a
correct statement of the position&mdash;Government was obviously
confronted with the question of what they were to do. Was this
state of affairs to continue or was it to be checked? We were
approached on all sides, in this Council and by such responsible
bodies as the British Indian Association, to intervene and to restore
some measure of law and order in a condition of things which was
fast drifting to chaos. In these circumstances we took the
measures of which the Council is well aware, namely, to declare
certain associations to be illegal, to introduce the Seditious
Meetings Act in one district and prohibit by order of the Commissioner
of Police, meetings and processions in Calcutta. I put it to
the Council that short of these measures it would not have been
possible to comply with the urgent requests so reasonably made to
us from so many quarters to intervene in the interests of decent
administration. That is the issue which is before the Council.
Is it or is it not a fact that on the 17th of last month the people of
this city were disgusted with the state of affairs and the prevailing
terrorism? Is it or is it not a fact that constant pressure was
brought to bear on Government by all sections of the people to
bring about a better state of affairs? Can it in truth be said that
the action of Government in attempting to curtail the activities of
the gentlemen to whom the excitement is due has gone beyond
the necessity of the case? If so, what is the alternative which
the Council would place before Government? Of that, however
we have heard singularly little, except from Babu Surendra Nath
Mallik, who advises us to withdraw all our orders, release prisoners,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
reduce sentences and place on their trial the military and the
police&mdash;a solution which, I trust, will not commend itself to the
better sense of the Council....</p>

<h2>APPENDIX XVI<br />
    BEHAR AND ORISSA</h2>

<p class="center">The Speech of the Hon. Mr. Macpherson, Member
of Government, at the meeting of the Legislative
Council Patna,</p>

<p class="center"><i>24th January 1922</i></p>

<p>Sir, I desire to intervene at this stage of the debate, because
I think it is proper that the House should know what the facts of
the situation are before they make speeches and commit themselves
to views which I hope they will be prepared to change after
they know what the facts of the situation really are. I must ask
your indulgence, if I find that what I have to say on this important
occasion will take me beyond the usual time limits.</p>

<p>This is not the first occasion on which the Government of
Behar and Orissa have explained to the public their attitude
towards the non-co-operation movement and their reasons for the
action taken on the 10th December last, which forms the subject
of this Resolution. As the council is well aware, His Excellency
the Governor received, a few days after that date, an influential
deputation of Council Members and explained to them under what
circumstances Government had been forced in defence of the public
safety to take action under the criminal Law Amendment Act. An
account of that deputation was published in all the newspapers
which are commonly read in this Province and I trust it has been
carefully perused by all the members of Council. I shall be
pardoned if, when I come to discuss the expediency of action taken
by Government, I go over again the ground covered by the
communique which was issued on that occasion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span></p>

<p>What was the position with which the Local Government
were faced in the beginning of that month? During the past twelve
months they have seen these associations growing in number and
boldness, spreading unrest throughout the public life of the
Province, poisoning and confusing the minds of simple people,
interfering with liberty of action, and not infrequently having to
resort to force in order to compel obedience to their mandates. I
have here a long list of cases in which persuasion was supplemented
by force, sometimes force of a very disgraceful kind but I will not
worry the Council by citing instances. This Province was not
alone in these experiences, the organization of a volunteer revolutionary
army was proceeding apace in neighbouring provinces also.
The danger was being gradually realized by the Government of
India and by other Local Governments, and before the end
of November action under the Criminal Law Amendment Act had
been taken by the Governments of the Punjab, the United Provinces
Delhi, Bengal, and Assam. The Government of Bihar and Orissa
stayed their hand till further inaction would have been criminal
folly. The two circumstances which brought matters to a head in
this province were</p>

<ol>

<li>the immediate imminence of the introduction of the civil
disobedience movement, particularly in the Tirhut
Division, and,</li>

<li>the intensive preparations which were being made to
organize a hostile <i>hartal</i> in Patna City against the
visit of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales on
the 22nd and 23rd December. I know that certain
local non-co-operation leaders have denied that there
was any intention to start the civil disobedience
movement within the Province during the month of
December or even up to the present date, and
we have been told that the Patna <i>Hartal</i> was
a spontaneous movement on the part of the citizens. I
think the Council will not be deceived by either of these
assurances. After all Government had to follow the evidence
at their disposal. There is one well-known leader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
of the local non-co-operation camp, called Mr. Dip Narayan
Singh. At a meeting held at Bhagalpur on the 16th
November this gentleman outlined the programme which
the leaders intended to follow. According to him a notice
calling upon Government to grant <i>Swaraj</i> within seven
days would first be served upon the chief civil officer
present in the locality selected for civil disobedience,
subsequently the residents of the particular locality would
be directed to disobey all orders and laws of Government
and to refuse to pay taxes, register documents, etc. At
the same time police stations and courts would be surrounded
and the officials told to deposit their uniforms
and other badges of offices. Thereafter police stations and
courts would be treated as <i>Swaraj</i> property. On the top
of this declaration of policy, the Local Government had
information that the first experiment would be made with
the Basantpur police station in the Chapra District. Now
this has been denied by the Congress party but the intention
was an open secret. I was told about it after our
last session by a member of this Council, who shall be
nameless, and apart from our police reports, we had it on
the authority of the <i>Motherland</i> dated the 26th November,
that Chapra had been selected as the first object
of attack. This is what the <i>Motherland</i> of November
29th, 1921, says. The heading is&mdash;</li>

</ol>

<p class="center">"<b>Civil Disobedience in Behar.</b>"</p>

<p>And the message runs:</p>

<p>"A meeting of the Provincial Congress Committee was held
at Patna on Sunday last. 33 delegates were elected for the coming
session of the Indian National Congress at Ahmadabad. It
was also resolved upon to form a volunteer corps in pursuance of
the resolution of the All India Working Committee. The matter
of selecting a suitable area for preparing it for Civil Disobedience
was referred to the Provincial Working Committee which met on
Monday last and decided in favour of Chapra in preference to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
claims of Katra Thana in the district of Muzaffarpur, which were
backed up by Muhammad Shafi."</p>

<p>The <i>Motherland</i> is a local organ of the revolutionary party
and the property of Mr. Mazharul Haqq, who is the one of the
shining lights in that camp, and presumably is in the confidance
of the party. We know also from the public press that the previous
volunteer associations, our old friends, the 'Khilafat' the
'Congress' and the 'Swaraj' volunteers were to be replaced by
a new organization to be called the "National Volunteers" and
we knew from our own reports that the particular name to be
affected by the new organization of non-violent volunteers in Behar
was the <i>Qaumi Sebak Dal</i>. Perhaps members of this Council
would like to know something about the organization of this Behar
<i>Sebak Dal</i>. This is what we heard about its organization.</p>

<p>Each squad was to consist of 20 volunteers. 20 squads would
make a company <i>Maha Dal</i>, in this there would be 400 volunteers.
Each squad would be under an officer.</p>

<p>Over 20 assistants there would be a higher officer. What he
would dictate all the four hundred volunteers would have to
observe.</p>

<p>The Bihar <i>Sebak Dal's</i> duty would be "Revolution" even if
they had to sacrifice their lives.</p>

<p>And this is what we were told about their plans of
campaign:</p>

<p>It was first to attack all the police-stations of the district and
to take them into their possession, after removing the Inspectors,
Jamadars and the Police.</p>

<p>When the thana had been taken possession of, then the
<i>Kachahri</i> would have to be taken possession of and the <i>Hakims</i>
would be removed.</p>

<p>Civil disobedience would commence in Chapra District from
village Basantpur, in Muzaffarpur from thana Katra, and then
Sitamarhi.</p>

<p>Such then was the information on which the Local Government
had to act. Does the Council still wonder that action of the
nature taken was taken? To those who protest that the information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
held by Government was unreliable I can only reply that it has
been fully corroborated not only by what has happened in other
Provinces and by published documents of the non-co-operation
movement but also by what has happened under our very noses in
this Province. The non-co-operators say that it was never in
contemplation to make an attack on Basantpur police-station on
the 10th December. We believe that this particular experiment
was nipped to the bud by the Notification of the same date, which
found the leaders assembled at Chapra and threw them into
consternation. But how do they explain the raids which were
actually made at a somewhat later date on the police-station of
Sonbarsa, Raghupur and Mahua in the District of Muzaffarpur, or
the attempt to picket the Gaya Civil Courts on the opening day
after the X'mas holidays, which was only frustrated by the
despatch of troops from Patna to Gaya on the previous evening?
Were all these fortuitous and accidental? Do all these evidences of
intention exist only in the heated imagination of the police? I shall
have occasion later to tell the Council what effect these raids have
had on the internal condition of the Muzaffarpur District. My
present object is only to prove that when the Local Government
took action under the Criminal Law Amendment Act on the 10th
December, they were fully justified in believing that the civil
disobedience movement would be started at a very early date in
the Tirhut Division.</p>

<p>I do not wish to weary the Council by going into details
regarding the Patna <i>hartal</i>. It seemed to Government, and with
good reason, that efforts were being made to impose an intolerable
tyranny on the citizens of Patna at a time when the representatives
of the people, who sit in this Council, had extended to his Royal
Highness a most cordial welcome and had voted a special grant to
make that welcome worthy of the occasion. The object of the non-co-operators
was to substitute for the welcome the same kind of
deliberate insult that had been attempted to be offered to the
Royal visitor at Benares and Allahabad. Government, I say,
would have been open to the gravest reproach if it had made no
effort to counteract that mean and wicked project, which was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
foreign to the innate hospitality and reverence of the Indian
people, and particularly repugnant, one would imagine, to the
sturdy loyalty of Bihar. Under this double compulsion then
Government decided that the time had come to follow the example
of its neighbours. Members of Council know as well as I do what
followed. There was, as Government expected there would be,
much excitement in the city&mdash;the stirring of a hornet nest always
has this sort of reaction.</p>

<p>Sir, let not this Council be deceived by any cry of repression,
by any false appeal for the freedom of association and the
freedom of speech. This Government is not out for repression.
It has no desire to interfere with political activity or freedom
of speech. When Mr. Gandhi and his friends use these phrases,
what they mean is license to preach sedition, and liberty to foment
rebellion and revolution. Let us see how the system works in
practice. I will read to the Council a recent report on condition of
the Muzaffarpur District. It is dated the 5th January:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Muzaffarpur District still continues to be in very disturbed
state particularly the Sitamarhi Subdivision, where it is reported
that law and order are decreasing daily and Magistrates are
even insulted in their own Courts. The Sitamarhi Sub-jail is
said to be practically in a state of mutiny, the prisoners shouting
and singing all day until about 10 <small>P.M.</small>, while on one occasion a
warder was rushed and knocked down. Additional police have
been asked for this subdivision and are badly required. The
Masses in this district are said to have no longer any dread of
going to jail owing to the inducements held out to them that they
will be treated as political prisoners and fare better than in their
own homes. The police have come in for more than their fair
share of attention from the non-co-operators during the week and
the Superintendent of Police is of opinion that his force has become
exasperated almost beyond endurance by the gross insults and abuse
that has been heaped upon them.</p>

<p>"On the 26th December 1921, about 200 volunteers escorted by
a large and noisy mob forced their way into the Sonbarsa Thana
compound in the Sitamarhi Subdivision, carrying swaraj flag and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
repeating the Delhi fatwa. The thana police were told that to remain
in Government service was for a Hindu equivalent to eating
cow's flesh and for a Muhammadan to eating pig. Later the crowd
became more insulting and abusive and though seven of the ringleaders
were arrested, the crowd did not disperse until nearly midnight.
Following this incident the whole of the thana staff were
boycotted, the services of the barber, washermen and even supplies
of food were stopped, until the divisional inspector succeeded in
intervening.</p>

<p>"At Raghupur Police-station in the same district, 300 volunteers
appeared and told the sub-inspector that on the 1st January they
would plant the swaraj flag in the compound and take possession
of the police-station. At Mahua Police-station, the Police were
also grossly abused and insulted and similar reports have been received
by the Superintendent of Police from other police stations
in the district.</p>

<p>"Mention was made in last week's report of a fracas in the
Court compound at Hajipur where alms were being distributed to
the poor. This was followed on the same day by a parade of 100
Sevak Dal volunteers in front of the Hajipur police-station who
shouted <i>Sarkar ki nokri karna haram hai</i> and grossly abused
the Police.</p>

<p>"Reports received from factories also indicate a serious state of
unrest in the Mufassal. Mr. G. P. Danby writing from Bowarrah
factory mentions that noisy shouting bands of volunteers are
moving about the country making themselves a general nuisance
and that to all appearance mob law prevails. The Belsand Factory
in this district is reported to have been surrounded on the 4th
January by a large mob shouting <i>Gandhi ki jai</i>. Europeans and
loyal Indians are expressing their disappointment that Government
did not continue strong measures against the non-co-operation
movement."</p>

<p>That is a police report, and lest the Council may think it is
highly coloured I will read a shorter note of the Divisional Commissioner,
Mr. Scroope, who is a man of sober judgment.</p>

<p>Mr. Mansfield, Subdivisional Officer Sitamarhi, came to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
me yesterday before I left for Bankipur. He is a level-headed
officer and in no sense an alarmist. He informed me that the
police are no longer able to deal with non-co-operators in Sitamarhi
town. The latter are practically in possession of the liquor shops
which they now picket with impunity. They also haunt the
neighbourhood of the Court and create much noise and disorder
during the trial to political cases. They ask to be arrested and
some of them who have been placed under trial under section 290,
Indian Penal Code have been grossly insulting to the Magistrate.
The journeys to and from Court of persons under trial for a political
offence are made regular occasions for noisy demonstrations
and abuse of Government. Mr. Mansfield's considered opinion is
that non-co-operators are now entirely out of hand, that the existing
police force is quite unequal to the task of keeping them in
check and that law and order have practically ceased to exist in
Sitamarhi town.</p>

<p>The sub-jail can only be described as in a state of mutiny. It
is much overcrowded containing about 90 inmates (I am not certain
of the exact number; almost all are under trials) and certain
influential non-co-operators under trials have been preaching defiance
and insubordination to their companions. The result is a
total absence of discipline; the undertrials sing and shout at the
top of their voices throughout the day and most of the night and
any attempts on the part of the warders to enforce order and obedience
are wholly ignored.</p>

<p>Here is a latter report of the doings of one of these roving
bands of whom mention is made in the police report. The Superintendent
of Police writes on the 21st January.</p>

<p>At the same time I received a telegram from Mr. Gray,
Meanchupra.</p>

<p>"All roads here stopped by volunteers. No carts or servants
allowed works. Come if possible, position critical".</p>

<p>I left at 2 <small>P.M.</small> and arrived Meanchupra at about 3 <small>P.M.</small></p>

<p>About 500 yards on the road west of Meanchupra I found
some volunteers sitting on a culvert guarding the road. On arrival
at the Bungalow I found Mr. and Mrs. Gray and their three children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
absolutely shut off and isolated by three volunteers. All the
Factory work had been stopped as the jamadar peons and coolies
were not allowed to enter the factory so that there was no one to
cut the sugarcane etc. All carts had been stopped, volunteers
cutting the ropes of the bullocks and driving them away. Even
the house servants had been stopped from going to the bungalow
from their village. There was no bearer, cooks <i>mashalchi</i>, <i>dhobe</i>,
garden coolies or even <i>murgiwala</i>. Mrs. Grey had to dig up the
potatoes in the garden, cook the food, wash up the dishes, etc., and
her ayah asked her (as well she might) if it was true that the British
Raj was over.</p>

<p>Sir, these are the facts which have already compelled Government
to post a force of additional police to the Sitamarhi subdivision,
and I do not disguise from the Council that they may
force us at no distant date to take even sterner measures to preserve
the peace of the district, and of other districts that are similarly
threatened. If Government find it necessary later to present
to Council a bill of costs which will not be at all to their liking, let
them thank their non-co-operation friends for the gift.</p>

<p>I know we shall be met with the old cry of repression,
but in this case it is a stupid cry. No Government of this
country wants repression for repression's sake, and least of
all the Government of Bihar and Orissa, which includes within
its number three distinguished Indians who have never been
accused of any lack of political independence. For my own
part I claim that no one welcomed more keenly than I did the
inauguration of the new reforms era in India. I had the confident
hope (and in this matter I speak also for my hon'ble
colleague, Sir Havilland Le Mesurier) that we had before us a
great and inspiring task of friendly co-operation with educated
Indians, which would at no very distant date place this country
in the forefront of the common-wealth of nations. Sir, this great
task has for the moment been heavily handicapped and hampered
by the poisonous cult of non-co-operation, a cult which has
embittered and clouded the political life of India and caused
discouragement to all the friends of reform. It has made life a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
burden and weariness to all ranks of Government officers, to the
responsible agents of Government in districts and to the directing
staff at headquarters but I have still hope that the better sense of
India will prevail and that the clouds will clear away. It is to
you, members of the Council, that Government look to give a
lead to the public which you represent, in the fight against this
great danger which menaces India. The danger is not one which
threatens only the officers of Government, professional men, and
men of wealth and property. The interests of the common
people, the patient cultivators and the toiling workmen, are just
as much at stake. It is they who will suffer most, if revolution
comes, as the same classes are suffering to-day in Russia where
they are perishing in millions as a result of the disintegration of
ordered Government. I call therefore upon the representatives of
all classes in this assembly to consider what is their duty, their
solemn duty, on this occasion. The choice is between the orderly
progress of India towards a future of brightest promise and the
perilous path of revolution which leads to darkness and death.
There is no midway between them. I appeal to you, gentlemen
of the Council, to put aside any pre-conceived notions or prepared
speeches with which you may have entered this hall to-day and to
look at the position in all its naked truth. The question you have
to decide for yourself is whether you stand for orderly Government
or revolution. I trust that the hon'ble mover himself will realize
his responsibility in the light of these remarks and withdraw his
resolution now that it has served its purpose of securing a full
discussion of the political situation.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX XVII<br />
    Disgraceful Tyranny</h2>

<p class="notequote">The following is taken from the speech delivered by the Hon.
Mr. Hammond, the officiating Chief Secretary of the Bihar and
Orissa Government, during the recent debate in the Provincial
Council on the political situation. <i>The Pioneer 1st February, 22.</i></p>

<p>Has the hon. member read what has just happened in Guntur,
in Madras, where rents are being withheld? Is he aware that not
in one but in two or three districts in the Province there have been
refusals to pay chaukidari taxes; that we have read not one but
several speeches advocating this refusal? May I tell the Council
that barely three or four days ago, in the district of Puri, a Panch
assessor was murdered while endeavouring to collect chaukidari
tax? Swami Vidyanand and others who followed and desclaimed
against repressive laws enquired what have the "volunteers"
done? It is a pertinent question, and, with your permission, Sir, I
will give a few instances by way of answer. Time does not allow
me to go through all their nefarious activities, but if Hon. members
want to know what the "volunteers" have done, apart from
enforced <i>hartal</i> and the ordinary common forms of secret
intimidation, ask the widow of the Mahomedan, Mazir Ali
Kalal, whose corpse was exhumed in Ranchi, thrown upon
the public road and the face beaten in with a brick; ask Gopi
Khar at Chatra, who on the 3rd January was beaten and taken
with his face blackened through the town because his wife committed
the foul crime of selling food to those who visited liquor shops.
Is that persuasion? Is this <i>Ahimsa</i>? ask the woman of Kateya,
Mussammatt Paremia Koerin, near Siwan, who was stripped naked
and driven through the village by a howling mob. She complained
as well she might to the Government police officer, who, when he
went to hold an enquiry was attacked by a mob&mdash;a demonstration
in force of soul-force! A speaker later in the debate declaimed
against those, the Planters and the police, whose courage, he said,
"took the form of delight in tyrannising over the poor and of oppressing
their fellow-countrymen." I ask in all sincerity what are
these cases I have related but a disgraceful tyranny; are they not,
indeed, 'oppression of the poor?' "What right?" I shall be asked
"have you to lay these crimes at the doors of the non-co-operation
party?" The answer is, that when men publicly oppose the funeral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
it is not irrational to believe that they are concerned with the
subsequent exhumation of the corpse. In the other cases I have
mentioned evidence has been taken and there is the judicial finding.</p>

<h3>North and South of the Ganges</h3>

<p>Another member asked me to explain the difference between
the positions north and south of the Ganges. Let us take this town
of Patna. The hon. member did not, as some do, deny <i>in toto</i>
that, there had been intimidation. I say there is in fact but little
difference. In Tirhut the crime manifest and overt, and in Patna
it is suppressed. Have the Council heard of those poor beggars
who received tickets entitling to go to Gulzarbagh on the morning
of the 22nd December and get blankets? Do they know that these
people were asked by "volunteers" on their way to show their
tickets which were then taken and torn up, that the same day some
of the beggars when returning from Gulzarbagh were deprived of
the blankets which they had been given which were burnt, and the
beggars had to be content with such warmth, as they could derive
from the glow of enforced patriotism. The difference between this
side of the Ganges and the other is that in Patna such things do not
unfortunately in a large city attract much attention.</p>

<p>Oh! the shame of it, a blind beggar woman deprived of her
blanket, but no violence of course was used, only soul-force. Babu
Ganesh Dutt appealed to justice and sympathy. Do these beggars
deserve no sympathy? Is there to be no justice done on their oppressors?
I shall be told that the leaders of the movement disavow
such action; that they deplore them as much as we do. Sir, we
cannot separate the methods from the ideals of the revolutionary
movement. I am prepared to believe that some of the leaders
deplore violence and would try to restrain it, but I maintain, and I
challenge, any hon. member here to disprove it that, conducted on
the lines as it is, admitting such members as it does to its ranks,
the non-co-operation movement must inevitably result in violence.</p>

<h3>The Giridih Riots</h3>

<p>Let us take the case to which reference had been made before
in this Council, the serious riots which occurred at Giridih, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
which ended in an attack upon the sub-jail and the thana and the
burning of the records. From what did that originate? It is a
simple story. A sold B a cow and said that she would yield
1&frac12; seers of milk. B took the cow away and found that he did
not get the guaranteed amount of milk. Lawyers here know that
the law of warranty is a somewhat difficult and intricate matter.
However the local self constituted Panches decided that, A should
take back the cow and refund the money. He declined to do so; and
then as sanction to enforce the orders of this local court applied
that cruel engine of oppression, social boycott. In all civilised communities
the black-mailer is regarded with disgust and condemned.
It has been for the non-co-operation party to use social blackmail
as the basis of sanction to its ideals. The inevitable result of such
a sanction is violence.</p>

<p>What are the "volunteers" doing? They are fishing in
troubled waters. They tried&mdash;let us once again come back
to Patna&mdash;to get the domestic servants to strike: they succeeded in
persuading some of the motor-car drivers to desert their masters
when their services were most required. What are the "volunteer's"
doing? They are persuading raiyats to withhold rent. I
know the case of a wealthy zamindar who had to borrow money
from the bank to pay his Government revenue. I maintain, sir,
that though honest men amongst the non-co-operators speak of non-violence
the movement must inevitably lead to violence.</p>

<p>Take an instance from private life&mdash;let us again quote from
Patna. A gentleman returning from Calcutta, a man well acquainted
with the law of the land, found that his servant had, at the
bidding of one gentleman who is an active recruiting officer of
"volunteers," decided to break the contract made with his master.
I have the best authority for saying this breach of contract resulted
in righteous indignation which took the form of personal violence.
What are these "volunteers" doing? They are provoking violence;
they are picketing; they are intimidating; they are interfering
between the master and servant, between landlord and tenant,
between the railway and its employees.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></div>

<h3>"Volunteers" Recruited from Criminal Classes</h3>

<p>I know it will be said that efforts have been made to purify the
ranks. It was found, for example, in Chapra, that <i>doms</i>, registered
as criminal tribes, were enlisted in the ranks of the national
"volunteers." From the other districts, too, came reports of ex-convicts
and persons of the "C" class register not only being enrolled
but being welcomed. The efforts to remove these members and
to purify the movement does not seem likely to be successful if
we may judge from a leader's experience in the Bhagalpur Division,
at Banka, in the district of Bhagalpur. There I am informed,
when he visited some villages with a view to expelling the undesirables,
he was himself expelled and told to mind his own business.
I submit, sir, for the earnest consideration of this Council
that you can not separate principles from methods or the ideals
from the agents who are employed. Lastly, we have had an
appeal that this Council should share the responsibility for maintenance
of law and order. We have been solemnly advised by
some of the speakers that Government should abdicate from the
duty imposed by Statute of maintaining law and order in favour
of these "volunteers" who were, so we are asked to believe, inaugurated
solely to prevent a recurrence of the scenes that occurred
in Bombay&mdash;to stop women being stripped of their clothes
in the streets, to stop murder and loot. Can Government for a
moment, in view of the activities I have related, contemplate
handing over the duty, the primary and essential duty of the
police, to the Kanmi Sevak Dal? The question has only to be
asked to show its absurdity.</p>

<h3>The question of Counter-Propaganda</h3>

<p>The only piece of practical advice we received from Mr. Madan
was that propaganda should be met by counter propaganda. But
there are difficulties.</p>

<p>First how many of the hon. members would be willing
to take up the task of propaganda? Secondly, how many
of them would be listened to if they did? How many of
these would be able to obtain a hearing? I confess it seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
to me, when Hon. members have protested that Government
do not publish all the facts, that the time may come when
every district and Sub-Divisional Magistrate ought to be
his own publicity officer. In the last week we should have
had stories in the papers of ladies being insulted in Monghyr,
pushed into the road, and spat upon. We should have read of the
wife of a settlement Officer, with her sister-in-law, being insulted
by school-boys one of the ladies having her head cut with a stone;
and from many districts we should have heard that pitiful tale of
little children whose lips can hardly lisp the popular war cry being
taught to shout it, not as a tale of admiration for an ascetic idealist,
nor as reverence for a person of mystic magnetism, but as a mark
of racial hatred, a hymn of hate. We could have published
instances from Muzaffarpur and Champaran of the insults to Europeans,
of mob roaming about shouting and committing mischief.
Hon. members would have heard of Magistrates unable to hold
trials because of the noise in the Court compounds. All these and
more should have been done in the way of counter propaganda,
exposing the methods of what is in fact a revolutionary movement,
but would much good have been done thereby? Is it not more
important to take steps to prevent such things happening? I ask
the hon. members to remember that every vote given in favour of
this resolution is a direct encouragement to the non-co-operation

<h2>APPENDIX XVIII<br />
    DEMAND FOR AN INDIAN "REPUBLIC"</h2>

<p class="center large">Mr. Hazrat Mohani's Address</p>

<p class="notequote"><span class="smcap">Ahmedabad, Dec. 30</span>&mdash;The following is the full text of the
authorised translation of the address, which Moulana Hazrat
Mohani delivered this afternoon and which was, from the beginning
to the end a plea for the declaration from the 1st January, 1922, of
an Indian Republic called the United States of India to be attained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
by all possible and proper means, including guerilla warfare in
case Martial Law was proclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>&mdash;While thanking you for electing me to preside
over this session of the All-India Muslim League I wish to say in
all sincerity that the importance of this session of the League, in
which the faith of Hindustan is to be decided required the choice
of a person abler than myself, such as Moulana Muhammed Ali,
Dr. Kitchlew or Moulana Abdul Kulam Azad to preside over its
deliberation but, unfortunately, the Government has forcibly
taken away the first two gentlemen from us, I express my inability
to accept the responsibility. Consequently, as the proverb goes,
"if thou dos't not accept it willingly, it will be forced on thee"
this great duty was placed on my weak shoulders. I wish to
discharge it to the best of my ability. Success is in the hand of God.</p>

<h3>The Aims of the League</h3>

<p>The present condition of the League appears to be very weak,
indeed, but this does not in the least derogate from its real
importance for it was the All-India Muslim League which actually
realised. The first and the most essential condition of Indian
independence is the Hindu-Muslim unity, and now that it has been
achieved it is the duty of the League to maintain it also. Besides,
it is on the platform of the League that all sections of political
opinion amongst the Musalmans, Extremists or Moderates, have
so far been and in future will, probably, be brought together.
Before going into the causes of the weakness of the League,
it will be better to enumerate the aims and object of the
League. These are (1) the attainment of Swaraj by the people
of India by all peaceful and legitimate means; (2) to protect and
advance the political, religious and other rights and interests
of the Indian Musalmans; (3) to promote friendship and union
between the Musalmans and other communities of India and (4)
to maintain and strengthen brotherly relations between the Musalmans
of India and those of other countries.</p>

<h3>The League an Old Calendar</h3>

<p>The first of these is also known to be the creed of the Congress.
Therefore, so long as the word Swaraj is not defined in consonance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
with Muslim desire and the means for its attainment are not
amplified, it is only natural that Muslim interests in League should
be clear. The third object, Hindu-Muslim unity, is the common
object both of the League and the Congress. The fourth object,
the unity of Muslim world, which has been, along with other
questions, connected with the Khilafat has been specially taken up
by the Khilafat Committee. There remains only the second object
that is the protection of the special interest of the Muslmans. As
to this, so long as a much greater and more important object, that
is, the attainment of Swaraj still remains unachieved, people would
rather direct their united efforts against the common enemy than
look after their special interests. They will be attended to when
the time comes for it. As if these causes were not sufficient in
themselves, to decrease Muslim influence in the League, its rules
and regulations were, unfortunately, so framed that, while public
opinion has developed at a rapid pace most members of the
League have not moved an inch from their first position. As a
result, the League remains nothing more than an old calendar.
It is very necessary to remove the causes of the weakness of the
League and to remove them immediately, for in proportion as we
approach nearer and nearer to the goal of Swaraj the need of the
League will be felt more and more, because questions of special
Muslim rights will rise again with greater importance when India
is free.</p>

<h3>An Indian "Republic"</h3>

<p>Our first duty, therefore, should be to reduce the fee for the
membership of the League and thus increase its members, who
will choose their representatives of the League every year. The
members to the Council of the Provincial and the All-India Muslim
Leagues should be chosen as in the case of the Congress every
year. But the most pressing necessity of all is a change in the
first object of the League to suit the changed Muslim conditions.
Everyone of us knows that the word Swaraj has been definitely
left vague and undefined in the creed of the Congress. The object
of it has been that, if the Khilafat and the Panjab wrongs, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
settled on the lines of our demands, then Swaraj within the British
Empire will be considered sufficient; otherwise efforts will be
directed towards the attainment of complete independence. But,
gentlemen from the Muslim point of view it is not enough that we
should stand for complete independence alone. It is necessary to
decide upon the form that it should take and in my opinion it can
only be an Indian Republic or on the lines of the United States of
India.</p>

<p>Besides this, the term "peaceful", which defines and restricts
the scope of the legitimate means for the attainment of
Swaraj in the Congress creed, is opposed to the nature and
religious aspirations of the Musalmans. Therefore, in the
creed of the League the words "possible" and "Proper"
should be substituted for the words "Legitimate" and
"Peaceful". I will explain the matter in detail. The Musalmans
should understand clearly that they derive a two-fold advantage
from the establishment of an Indian Republic, firstly, the
general benefit which they will undoubtedly share along with their
Indian brethren as citizens of a common State and secondly, the
special advantage which the Musalmans will derive from it is that,
with every decline in the prestige and power of the British Empire,
which, to-day is the worst enemy of Muslim countries, the Muslim
world will get breathing time and opportunity to improve its conditions.
Gentlemen, in spite of the present Hindu-Muslim unity,
there still exists many serious misunderstandings and suspicions
between these two great communities of Hindustan, and it is of
primary importance that we should grasp the true nature of these
misunderstandings. The Hindus have a lurking suspicion that
given an opportunity, the Musalmans will either invite their co-religionists
from outside to invade India or will, at least help them,
in case they invaded to plunder and devastate Hindustan, and these
misunderstandings are so deep-rooted and widespread that, so far
as my knowledge goes, no Indian statesman has escaped it, except
the late Lokamanya Tilak. On the other hand, the Musalmans
suspect that on the achievement of Self-Government, the Hindus
will acquire greater political powers and will use their numerical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
superiority to crush the Musalmans. Gentlemen, it is quite clear
that these misunderstandings can only be won over by a compromise
discussion and mutual and intimate knowledge, and it is an
essential condition of this mutual understanding that the third party
should not come between them.</p>

<h3>Hindus and Muslims</h3>

<p>The generality of Musalmans, with few exceptions, are afraid
of the numerical superiority of the Hindus and are absolutely
opposed to an ordinary reform scheme as a substitute for complete
independence. The primary reason for this is that in a
merely reformed, as contrasted with an independent Government
they will be under a double suspicion, first, a subjection to the
Government of India, which will be common to Hindus and
Musalmans, secondly, a rejection by a Hindu majority, which they
will have to face in every department of the Government. On
the other hand, if the danger of the English power is removed, the
Musalmans will only have the Hindu Majority to fear. Fortunately
this fear is such as will be automatically removed, with the
establishment of the Indian republic for, while the Musalmans, as a
whole, are in a minority in India, yet Nature has provided a compensation,
for the Musalmans are not in a minority in all Provinces.
In some Provinces, such as Kashmere, the Punjab, Sind,
Bengal and Assam, the Musalmans are more numerous than the
Hindus. This Muslim majority will be an assurance that in the
United States of India the Hindu majority in Madras, Bombay
and the United Provinces will not be allowed to overstep the
limits of moderation against the Musalmans. Similarly, so long
as a completely liberated India does not come into the hands of
the Hindus and Musalmans themselves, the Hindus will be always
suspicious that, in case of a foreign invasion, the Musalmans will
aid their co-religionist invaders, but on the establishment of the
Indian Republic, which will be shared in common by the Musalmans
and Hindus there will be no possibility of such a suspicion,
for no Musalman will desire that the power of even a Muslim
foreigner should be established over this country.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></div>

<h3>The Mopla Rebellion</h3>

<p>Gentlemen, I have just stated it as a necessary condition
of the Hindu-Muslim compromise that the third party, the
English, should not be allowed to step in between us. Otherwise,
all our affairs will fall into disorder. Its best example is
before you in the shape of the Mopla incident. You are probably
aware that Hindu India has an open and direct complaint against
the Moplas and an indirect complaint against all of us that the
Moplas are plundering and spoiling their innocent Hindu neighbours,
but probably, you are not aware that the Moplas justify their action
on the ground that at such a critical juncture, when they are
engaged in a war against the English, their neighbours not only do
not help them or observe neutrality, but aid and assist the English
in every possible way. They can, no doubt, contend that, while
they are fighting a defensive war for the sake of their religion and
have left their houses, property and belongings and taken refuge in
hills and jungles, it is unfair to characterise as plunder their
commandeering of money, provisions and other necessaries for
their troops from the English or their supporters. Gentlemen,
both are right in their complaints, but so far as my investigation
goes, the cause of this mutual recrimination can be traced to the
interference of the third party. It happens thus, whenever any
English detachment suddenly appears in the locality and kills or
captures the Moplas inhabitants of the place, rumour somehow
spreads in the neighbourhood that the Hindu inhabitants of the
place had invited the English army for their protection, with the
result that after the departure of the English troops the
Moplas or their neighbours do not hesitate to retaliate and
consider the money and other belongings of the Hindus as lawful
spoils of war taken from those who have aided and abetted the
enemy. Where no such events have occurred, the Moplas and
Hindus even now live peacefully side by side, Moplas do not commit
any excesses against the Hindus, while the Hindus do not
hesitate in helping the Moplas to the best of their ability.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></div>

<h3>A National Parliament.</h3>

<p>I have wandered far from my purpose, I meant to emphasise
that, in the first clause dealing with the aims and objects of the
League, the word "Swaraj" should be defined as complete
republic. Otherwise, there is a danger that in the presence of a
third party, Self-Government within the British Empire, instead of
being beneficial, might actually prove injurious. The second
amendment necessary is that the methods for the attainment of
Swaraj should be amplified. In the place "peaceful" and "legitimate"
means "possible" and "proper" should be permitted.
Thus, on the one hand, the opportunity of joining the League will
be given to those who do not honestly believe Non-Co-operation
alone as the sole path of salvation, recognising the possibility of
other methods and adopting them also. On the other hand, the
amendment will remove the complaint of those who believe the
Non-Co-operation can under no circumstances, remain peaceful to
the last, and while subscribing to the creed of the Congress and
the first clause of the section dealing with the object of the League
as a matter of policy and expediency, refuse to admit it as a faith
for all times and circumstances or to remain non-violent even in
intention.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, there are only two possible means of replacing
one Government by another one, the destruction of the
Government by sword and the establishment of another in
its place, a method which has been followed in the world thus
far. The second alternative is to sever all connection with the
present Government, and to set up a better or organised Government:
parallel to it and improve and develop it till the old order
is dissolved and the new takes its place. Friends, to achieve
this object, we must immediately set upon a separate and
permanent foundation our courts, schools, arts, industries,
army, police and a national parliament. Non-violent Non-Co-operation
can only help to paralyse the Government,
but cannot maintain it. The question now is, can such a
parallel Government be established only through non-violent
non-co-operation of course, provided the rival Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
does not interfere with its establishment, a condition which is
obviously impossible. The rival Government will certainly interfere.
We might contend that we will proceed on with our work
silently and quietly and in spite of governmental interference as is
being done at present. A stage will, however, be reached ultimately
when action on peaceful lines will absolutely become impossible,
and then we will be forced to admit that a parallel Government
can be started, but not continue to the last through peaceful means.</p>

<h3>Governmental Policy</h3>

<p>The example of Governmental repression is before your eyes.
First, it attempted through Karachi trials to prevent the Musalmans
from openly proclaiming the articles of their faith, when the people,
undaunted by this decision of the Government, preached through
the length and breadth of India that it was unlawful to serve in the
army. The Government slowly overlooked those activities fearing
lest a mere repetition of the Karachi resolution might lead to disaffection
in the Army, and in order to divert the attention of the
people from those activities, it suddenly, but deliberately declared
the enrollment as unlawful. That might get an opportunity of
striking at the Non-Co-operators. Like the moths that gather to
sacrifice their lives round lighted candle, the advocates of civil disobedience
swarmed to break this declaration of Lord Reading and
cheerfully went in their thousands to gaol. This is undoubtedly an
example of self-sacrifice and self-effacement which will rightly
move Mahatma Gandhi to ecstasy, but we detect another truth
hidden in this demonstration of happiness and joy. It reveals to our
eyes the last stage of both the repression of the Government and
the patience of the people. The people are, no doubt, prepared to
bear and suffer gladly the hardships of a few days of imprisonment
but on the declaration of Martial Law the non-violent Non-Co-operation
movement will prove totally insufficient and useless.
Amongst the Musalmans, at least there will hardly be found a man
who will be prepared to sacrifice his life uselessly. A man can only
have one of the two feelings in his heart, when faced by the barrel
of a gun, either to seek refuge in flight or to take advantage of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
law of self-preservation and despatch adversary to hell. The third
alternative of cheerfully yielding up one's life to the enemy and
considering it to be the one real success will remain confined to
Mahatma Gandhi and some of his adherents and fellow thinkers. I,
on my part, fear that in general the reply to the Martial Law will
be what is commonly called guerilla warfare, or in the words of the
Quran "kill them wherever you find them." The responsibility
lies with the representatives of the Musalmans. The members of
the All-India Muslim League, should consider it their duty either
to refrain from adopting Non-Co-operation as their creed or free it
from the limitation of keeping it, either by violence or non-violence,
for it is not in our power to keep Non-Co-operation peaceful or
otherwise. So long as the Government confines to the use of
chains and fetters, Non-Co-operation can remain peaceful as it is
to-day, but if things go further and the Government has recourse
to gallows or machine guns it will be impossible for the movement
to remain non-violent.</p>

<h3>Duty of Muslims</h3>

<p>At this stage, some people would like to ask how is it that,
while the Hindus are content to adopt non-violent non-co-operation
as the means for attaining independence, that the Musalmans
are anxious to go a step further. The answer is that the liberation
of Hindustan is as much a political duty of Musalmans as that of a
Hindu. Owing to the question of Khilafat it has become a Musalman's
religious duty also.</p>

<p>In this connection I should like to say just one word. The
glories of Ghazhi Mustapha Kemal Pasha and the conclusion of
the recent Franco-Turkish Treaty might create an idea in some
people's minds that the evacuation of Smyrna by the Greeks is
certain, and the restoration of Thrace to the Turks if not certain
is within the bounds of possibility. Consequently they might
entertain the hope that the struggle in the Near East is coming to
a close. I want to warn all such people that the claims of the
Musalmans of India are founded more on religious than political
principles. So long as the Jazirat-ul-Arab (including Palestine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
and Mesopotamia) are not absolutely freed from non-Muslim influence,
and so long as the political and military power of the
Khilafat is not fully restored the Musalmans of India cannot suspend
their activities and efforts.</p>

<h3>The Muslim Demands</h3>

<p>The Muslim demands as regards the Khilafat are these:&mdash;(1)
that in the pursuance of the promise of Mr. Lloyd George, Thrace
and Shayrna, along with the city of Smyrna, should remain purely
under Turkish control, so that the political status of the Khilafat
Musalman, which is essential for the Khilafat should suffer no
diminution, (2) all non-Turkish control should be removed from
Constantinople, the shores of Marmora and the Dardanelles in
order that the Khilafat at Constantinople may not be under non-Muslim
control, which is essential for the Khilafat; (3) all
naval and military restrictions imposed on the Khilafat should be
removed, as otherwise, he would have no power to enforce the
orders of the Khilafat; (4) the Jazirat-ul-Arab, including the
Hedjaz, Palestine, and Mesopotamia, should be free from all non-Muslim
influence and not be under the British mandate, as it was
the death-bed injunction of the prophet. It should be noted that
in the fourth demand we wish the English to give up their mandate
of Mesopotamia and Palestine and remove their influence from the
Hedjaz. As to the question whether the Arabs will acknowledge
the Sheriff of Mecca or the Sultan of Turkey as their Khilafat, or
whether the Arab Government of Hedjaz, Mesopotamia and Palestine
will be independant or under the suzerainty of the Khilafat,
they will be decided by the Musalmans. We do not want non-Muslim
advice and assistance.</p>

<h3>A Compact Between Congress and League</h3>

<p>In my opinion, gentlemen, the most pressing necessity of
Hindustan is the immediate conclusion of a definite compact between
the Congress and the League. The Congress should not
enter into any negotiations with the Government concerning
Swaraj (1) until the minimum Muslim demands with regard
the Khilafat are satisfied; (2) on the other hand, the Muslim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
should definitely bind themselves that even though their demands
with regard to the Khilafat are satisfied, they, the Musalmans
of India, will stand to the last by the side of their Hindu brethren
for the attainment and preservation of Indian independence.
Such a compact is necessary for the work because there are signs
of the enemies of Indian independence, and we have to confess
with regret that a number of deceitful Indians working with the
foreigners are concentrating all their efforts to wreck the Hindu
Muslim unity and create distrust and misunderstanding between
the two communities. On the one hand, the Musalmans are being
enticed by false hopes with regard to the Khilafat question. On
the other some show toys of political concessions are being
prepared as a gift for the Hindus even before the stipulated period
of ten years. It is intended that in simplicity, the Musalmans
should consider the return of Smyrna, etc, as the satisfaction their
Khilafat demands, and slacken their efforts for the attainment of
Swaraj, while the Hindus should be misled into believing a further
instalment of reforms as the Swaraj itself, or at least, its precursor
and begin to consider the Khilafat as an irrelevant question.
There can be only one solution for all these problems. Hindus
and Musalmans after mutual consultation, should have Indian
independence declared by Mahatma Gandhi, and that in future
neither the English might have an opportunity of deceiving nor
India of being deceived. After the declaration of independence,
the Congress and the League will have only one object left; that is
preservation of Swaraj. The 1st January, 1922, is the best date
for the purpose because we would thus have fulfilled the promise
that we made to attain Swaraj within this year, and the people of
India will achieve success in the eyes of God and man.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX XIX<br />
    GOVERNMENT REPLIES.</h2>

<p class="center">Mr. Gandhi's Misstatements.</p>

<p class="notequote gap-above">"<i>Mass civil disobedience is fraught with such danger to the
State that it must be met with sternness and severity."</i></p>

<p class="notequote"><i>So says the Government of India (Home Department) in
the communique published below in reply to Mr. Gandhi's
manifesto offering a postponement of civil disobedience on
certain conditions which Government regard as impossible.</i></p>

<p class="notequote"><i>The Government statement makes it clear that the issue is
between lawlessness and the maintenance of civilised government.</i></p>

<p>The manifesto issued by Mr. Gandhi on the 4th February
justifying his determination to resort to mass civil disobedience
contains a series of misstatements. Some of these are so
important that the Government of India cannot allow them to pass
unchallenged. In the first place they emphatically repudiate the
statement that they have embarked on a policy of lawless repression
and also the suggestion that the present campaign of civil
disobedience has been forced on the non-co-operation party, in
order to secure the elementary rights of free association, free speech
and of a free press. The Government of India desire to draw
attention to the fact that the decision to adopt a programme of
civil disobedience was finally accepted on the 4th November,
before the recent notification relating either to the Seditious Meetings
Act or the Criminal Law Amendment Act, to which Mr.
Gandhi unmistakeably refers were issued. It was in consequence
of serious acts of lawlessness, committed by persons who professed
to be followers of Mr. Gandhi and the non-co-operation movement,
that the Government were forced to take measures, which are in
strict accordance with the law for the protection of peaceful citizens
in the pursuit of their lawful avocations.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></div>

<h3>A new and dangerous situation</h3>

<p>Since the inauguration of the non-co-operation movement
the Government of India actuated by a desire to avoid anything
in the nature of the repression of political activity, even though
it was of an extreme character, have restricted their action in
relation thereto to such measures as were necessary for the
maintenance of law and order and the preservation of public
tranquility. Up to November no steps, save in Delhi last year,
were taken against the volunteer associations. In November,
however, the Government were confronted with a new and dangerous
situation. In the course of the past year, there had been
systematic attempts to tamper with the loyalty of the soldiers and
the police, and there had occurred numerous outbreaks of serious
disorders, directly attributable to the propaganda of the non-co-operation
party amongst the ignorant and excitable masses. These
outbreaks had resulted in grave loss of life, the growth of a dangerous
spirit of lawlessness, and increasing disregard for lawful
authority. In November they culminated in the grave riots in
Bombay, in which 53 persons lost their lives and approximately
400 were wounded. On the same date dangerous manifestations
of lawlessness occurred in many other places, and at this period it
became clear that many of the volunteer associations had embarked
on a systematic campaign of violence, intimidation and obstruction,
to combat which proceedings under the Penal Code and the Code
of Criminal procedure had proved ineffective.</p>

<h3>More drastic Measures</h3>

<p>In these circumstances the Government were reluctantly
compelled to resort to measures of a more comprehensive and
drastic character. Nevertheless, the operation of the Seditious
Meetings Act was strictly limited to a few districts in which the
risk of grave disturbance of the peace was specially great, and the
application of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1908 was confined
to associations, the majority of the members of which had
habitually indulged in violence and intimidation. It is impossible
here to set out in detail the evidence which justified the adoption
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
of these measures in the different provinces. Abundant proof is,
however, to be found in the published proceedings of the various
legislative bodies, in the <i>Communiques</i> of the different local Governments,
and in the pronouncements of the heads of the provinces.
While resolute in their determination to enforce respect for law and
order and to protect loyal and peaceful subjects of the Crown, the
Government have at the same time taken every precaution possible
to mitigate where desirable the conditions of imprisonment and to
avoid any action which might have the appearance of vindictive
severity. Ample proof of this will be found in the orders issued by
the local Governments. Numerous offenders have been released,
sentences have been reduced and special consideration has been
shown in the case of persons convicted of offences under the Seditious
Meeting's Act or the Criminal Law Amendment Act. There
is thus no shadow of justification for the charge that their policy
has been one of indiscriminate and lawless repression.</p>

<h3>A statement disproved</h3>

<p>A further charge, which has been brought to Mr. Gandhi
is that the recent measures of Government have involved
a departure from the civilised policy laid down by His Excellency
at the time of the apology of the Ali brothers, namely,
that the Government of India should not interfere with the
activities of the non-co-operators so long as they remained
non-violent in word and deed. The following citation from the
<i>communique</i> of Government of India issued on the 30th May,
conclusively disproves this statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After explaining that in view of the solemn undertaking contained
in the statement over their signature it had been decided to
refrain from instituting criminal proceedings against Messrs.
Mahammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, the Government of India observed,
it must not be inferred from the original determination of the
Government to prosecute for speeches inciting to violence that promoting
disaffection of a less violent character is not an offence
against the law. The Government of India desire to make it plain
that they will enforce the law relating to offences against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
State, as and when they may think fit against any persons who have
committed breaches of it."</p>

<h3>The proposed conference</h3>

<p>It remains for the Government of India to deal with the allegation
that His Excellency summarily rejected the proposal for a
conference, although the terms put forward by the conference at
Bombay and accepted by the Working Committee of the Congress
were quite in keeping with His Excellency's own requirements as
indicated in his speech at Calcutta. How far this is from being
the case will manifest from a comparison of his Excellency's speech
with the terms proposed by the conference. His Excellency
in that speech insisted on the imperative necessity, as a fundamental
condition precedent to the discussion of any question of a conference
of the discontinuance, of the unlawful activities of the
non-co-operation party. No assurance on this point, was, however
contained in proposals advanced by the conference. On the
contrary, whilst the Government were asked to make concessions
which not only included the withdrawal of the notifications under
the Criminal Law Amendment and Seditious Meetings Acts and
the release of persons convicted thereunder but also this release of
persons convicted of offences designed to affect the loyalty of the
army; and the submission to an arbitration committee of the cases
of other persons convicted under the ordinary law of the land, there
was no suggestion that any of the illegal activities of the non-co-operators
other than hartals, picquetting and civil disobedience
should cease. Moreover, it was evident from the statements made
by Mr. Gandhi at the conference, that he intended to continue the
enrolment of volunteers in prohibital associations and preparations
for civil disobedience. Further, Mr. Gandhi made also it is apparent
that the proposed round table conference would be called merely
to register his decrees. It is idle to suggest that terms of this
character fulfilled in any way the essentials laid down by His
Excellency or can reasonably be described as having been made
in response to the sentiments expressed by him.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></div>

<h3>Impossible Requests.</h3>

<p>Finally, the Government of India desire to draw attention to
the demands put forward in the concluding para of Mr. Gandhi's
present manifesto, which exceeded even the demands made by the
Working Committee of the Congress. Mr. Gandhi's demands now
include: (1) the release of all prisoners convicted or under trial
for non-violent activities; (2) a guarantee that Government will
refrain absolutely from interference with all non-violent activities
of the non-co-operation party, even though they fall within the
purview of the Indian Penal Code, or in other words an undertaking
that Government will indefinitely hold in abeyance in regard
to the non-co-operators the ordinary and long established law of
the land. In return for these concessions he indicated that he
intends to continue the illegal and seditious propaganda and
operation of the non-co-operation party and merely appears to
postpone civil disobedience of an aggressive character until the
offenders now in jail have had an opportunity of reviewing the
whole situation. In the same paragraph he re-affirms the unalterable
character of the demands of his party. The Government
of India are confident that all right thinking citizens will recognise
that this manifesto constitutes no response whatever to the
speech of His Excellency at Calcutta and that the demands made
are such as no Government could discuss, much less accept.</p>

<h3>Issue&mdash;Law versus lawlessness</h3>

<p>The alternatives that now confront the people of India are
such as sophistry can no longer obscure or disguise. The issue
is no longer between this or that programme of political advance,
but between lawlessness with all its dangerous consequences on the
one hand, and on the other the maintenance of those principles
which lie at the root of all civilised Government. Mass civil
disobedience is fraught with such danger to the State, that it must
be met with sternness and severity. The Government entertain
no doubt that in any measures which they may have to take for
its suppression, they can count on the support and assistance of
all law-abiding and loyal citizens of His Majesty.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX XX<br />
    N.C.O. RESOLUTION</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Ahmedabad, December 28.</i></p>

<p>The following was put by Mahatma Gandhi. "Whereas
since the holding of the last National Congress, the people of
India have found from actual experience that by reason of the
adoption of non-violent non-co-operation the country has made
great advance in fearlessness, self-sacrifice and self-respect, and
whereas the movement has greatly damaged the prestige of the
Government, and, whereas, on the whole the country is rapidly
progressing towards Swaraj, this Congress confirms the resolution
adopted at the Special session of the Congress at Calcutta and
reaffirmed at Nagpur, and places on record the fixed determination
of the Congress to continue the programme of non-violent non-co-operation
with greater vigour than hitherto, in such manner as
each province may determine, till the Punjab and the Khilafat
wrongs are redressed and Swaraj is established, and the control
of the Government of India passed into the hands of the people,
from that of an irresponsible corporation, and whereas the reason
of the threat uttered by his Excellency the Viceroy in recent
speeches and the consequent repression started by the Government
of India, in the provinces by way of disbandment of Volunteer
corps and forcible prohibition of public and even committee
meetings in an illegal and high handed manner, and by the arrests
of many Congress workers in several provinces, and whereas
this repression is manifestly intended to stifle all Congress and
Khilafat activities and deprive the public of their assistance, this
Congress resolves that all activities of the Congress be suspended,
as far as necessary, and appeals to all quietly and without any
demonstration to offer themselves for arrest by belonging to the
Volunteer organisations to be formed throughout the country in
terms of the resolution of the Working Committee, arrived at in
Bombay, on the 23rd day of November last, provided that no one shall
be accepted as Volunteer who does not sign the following pledge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></div>

<h3>The Pledge</h3>

<p>"With God as witness, I solemnly declare that (1) I
wish to be a member of the National Volunteer Corps;
(2) So long as I remain a member of the Corps, I shall
remain non-violent in word and deed, and shall earnestly endeavour
to be non-violent in intent, since I believe that as India is
circumstanced non-violence can help the Khilafat and the Punjab
and result in the attainment of Swaraj and consolidation of unity
among all the races and communities of India, whether Hindu,
Mussalman, Sikh, Parsi Christian or Jew; (3) I believe in and
shall endeavour always to promote such unity; (4) I believe in
Swadeshi as essential for India's economic, political and moral
salvation, and shall use handspun and hand-woven Khaddar to the
exclusion of every other cloth; (5) as a Hindu, I believe in the
justice and necessity of removing the evil of untouchability and
shall on all possible occasions seek personal contact with, and
endeavour to render service to, the submerged classes; (6) I shall
carry out the instructions of my superior officers and all the
regulations not inconsistent with the spirit of this pledge prescribed
by the Volunteer Boards or the Working Committee or any other
agency established by the Congress; (7) I am prepared to suffer
imprisonment, assault, or even death for the sake of my religion,
and my country, without resentment; (8) in the event of my imprisonment,
I shall not claim from the Congress any support for
my family or dependants.</p>

<h3>Volunteer corps</h3>

<p>"This Congress trusts that every person of the age of 18 and
over will immediately join the Volunteer organisations. Notwithstanding
the proclamation prohibiting public meetings, and inasmuch
as even Committee meetings have been attempted to be
construed as public meetings, this Congress advises the holding of
Committee meeting in enclosed places and by tickets and by
previous announcements, at which as far as possible only speakers
previously announced shall deliver written speeches, care being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
taken, in every case, to avoid the risk of provocation and possible
violence by the public in consequence.</p>

<p>"This Congress is further of opinion that Civil Disobedience
is the only civilized and effective substitute for an armed rebellion,
whenever every other remedy for preventing arbitrary,
tyrannical and emasculating use of authority by individuals or
corporations, has been tried and, therefore, advises all Congress
workers and others who believe in peaceful methods and are
convinced that there is no remedy save some kind of sacrifice to
dislodge the existing Government from its position of perfect
irresponsibility to the people of India, to organise individual Civil
Disobedience, and massed, when the mass of people have been
sufficiently trained in the methods of non-violence, and otherwise
in terms of the resolution therein of the last meeting of the All-India
Congress Committee held at Delhi, this Congress is of
opinion that in order to concentrate its attention upon Civil Disobedience,
whether mass or individual (whether of an offensive or
defensive character) under proper safeguards, and under instructions
to be issued from time to time by the Working Committee or
Provincial Congress Committee concerned, all other Congress
activities should be suspended whenever and wherever, and to the
extent to which it may be found necessary.</p>

<h3>Mahatma the dictator</h3>

<p>"This Congress calls upon all students of the age of 18 and
over, particularly those studying in the national institutions and
the staff thereof, immediately to sign the foregoing pledge and
become members of National Volunteer Corps.</p>

<p>"In view of the impending arrest of a large number of
Congress workers, this Congress, whilst requiring the ordinary
machinery to remain intact and to be utilised in the
ordinary manner whenever feasible, hereby appoints until
further instructions Mahatma Gandhi as the sole Executive authority
of the Congress and invests him with the full powers of the
All-India Congress Committee including the power to convene a
special session of the Congress or of the All-India Congress Committee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
or the Working Committee, and also with power to appoint
a successor in emergency.</p>

<p>"This Congress hereby confers upon the said successor and
all subsequent successors appointed in turn by their predecessors,
all this aforesaid power provided that nothing in this resolution
shall be deemed to authorise Mahatma Gandhi or any of the aforesaid
successors to conclude any terms of peace with the Government
of India or the British Government without the previous
sanction of the All-India Congress Committee to be finally ratified
by the Congress specially convened for the purpose, (and provided
also that the present Creed of the Congress shall in no case be
altered by Mahatma Gandhi or his successors except with the leave
of the Congress first obtained).</p>

<p>"This Congress congratulates all those patriots who are now
undergoing imprisonment for the sake of their conscience or country,
and realises that their sacrifice has considerably hastened the
advent of Swaraj."</p>

<h2>APPENDIX XXI<br />
    Mr. M. K. Gandhi's Statement</h2>

<p>Before reading his written statement Mr. Gandhi spoke a few
words as introductory remarks to the whole statement. He said:
Before I read this statement, I would like to state that I entirely
endorse the learned Advocate-General's remarks in connection with
my humble self. I think that he was entirely fair to me in all the
statements that he has made, because it is very true and I have no
desire whatsoever to conceal from this Court the fact that to
preach disaffection towards the existing system of Government has
become almost a passion with me. And the learned Advocate-General
is also entirely in the right when he says that my preaching
of disaffection did not commence with my connection with
"Young India" but that it commenced much earlier and in the
statement that I am about to read it will be my painful duty to
admit before this Court that it commenced much earlier than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
period stated by the Advocate-General. It is the most painful
duty with me but I have to discharge that duty knowing the
responsibility that rested upon my shoulders.</p>

<p>And I wish to endorse all the blame that the Advocate-General
has thrown on my shoulders in connection with the Bombay
occurrence, Madras occurrences, and the Chouri Choura occurrences
thinking over these things deeply, and sleeping over them
night after night and examining my heart I have come to the conclusion
that it is impossible for me to dissociate myself from the diabolical
crimes of Chouri Choura or the mad outrages of Bombay.
He is quite right when he says that as a man of responsibility, a
man having received a fair share of education, having had a fair
share of experience of this world, I should know the consequences
of every one of my acts. I knew them. I knew that I was playing
with fire. I ran the risk and if I was set free I would still do the
same. I would be failing in my duty if I do not do so. I have felt it
this morning that I would have failed in my duty if I did not say
all what I said here just now. I wanted to avoid violence.
Non-violence is the first article of my faith. It is the last
article of my faith. But I had to make my choice. I had either
to submit to a system which I considered has done an irreparable
harm to my country or incur the risk of the mad fury of my people
bursting forth when they understood the truth from my lips. I
know that my people have sometimes gone mad. I am deeply
sorry for it; and I am, therefore, here to submit not to a light
penalty but to the highest penalty. I do not ask for mercy. I do
not plead any extenuating act. I am here, therefore, to invite and
submit to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for
what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be
the highest duty of a citizen. The only course open to you, Mr.
Judge, is, as I am just going to say in my statement, either to
resign your post or inflict on me the severest penalty if you believe
that the system and law you are assisting to administer are good
for the people. I do not expect that kind of conversion. But by
the time I have finished with my statement you will, perhaps, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
a glimpse of what is raging within my breast to run this maddest
risk which a sane man can run.</p>

<h3>WRITTEN STATEMENT</h3>

<p>I owe it perhaps to the Indian public and to the public in England
to placate which this prosecution is mainly taken up that I
should explain why from a staunch loyalist and co-operator I have
become an uncompromising disaffectionist and non-co-operator.
To the court too I should say why I plead guilty to the charge of
promoting disaffection towards the Government established by law
in India.</p>

<p>My public life began in 1893 in South Africa in troubled
weather. My first contact with British authority in that country
was not of a happy character. I discovered that as a man and an
Indian I had no rights. On the contrary I discovered that I had
no rights as a man because I was an Indian.</p>

<p>But I was not baffled. I thought that this treatment of
Indians was an excrescence upon a system that was intrinsically
and mainly good. I gave the Government my voluntary and
hearty co-operation, criticising it fully where I felt it was faulty
but never wishing its destruction.</p>

<p>Consequently when the existence of the Empire was threatened
in 1899 by the Boer challenge, I offered my services to it,
raised a volunteer ambulance corps and served at several actions
that took place for the relief of Ladysmith. Similarly in 1906 at
the time of the Zulu revolt I raised a stretcher-bearer party and
served till the end of the 'rebellion'. On both these occasions
I received medals and was even mentioned in despatches.
For my work in South Africa I was given by Lord Hardinge a
Kaiser-i-Hind Gold Medal. When the war broke out in 1914
between England and Germany I raised a volunteer ambulance
corps in London consisting of the then resident Indians in London,
chiefly students. Its work was acknowledged by the authorities to
be valuable. Lastly in India when a special appeal was made at
the War Conference in Delhi in 1917 by Lord Chelmsford for
recruits, I struggled at the cost of my health to raise a corps in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
Kheda and the response was being made when the hostilities ceased
and orders were received that no more recruits were wanted. In
all these efforts at service I was actuated by the belief that was
possible by such services to gain a status of full equality in the
Empire for my countrymen.</p>

<p>The first shock came in the shape of the Rowlatt Act a law
designed to rob the people of all real freedom. I felt called upon
to lead an intensive agitation against it. Then followed the Punjab
horrors beginning with the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh and culminating
in crawling orders, public floggings and other indescribable
humiliations. I discovered too that the plighted word of the
Prime Minister to the Mussulmans of India regarding the integrity
of Turkey and the holy places of Islam was not likely to be fulfilled.
But in spite of the foreboding and the grave warnings of friends,
at the Amritsar Congress in 1919 I fought for co-operation and
working the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, hoping that the Prime
Minister would redeem his promise to the Indian Mussulmans, that
the Punjab wound would be healed and that the reforms inadequate
and unsatisfactory though they were, marked a new era of hope in
the life of India.</p>

<p>But all that hope was shattered. The Khilafat promise was
not to be redeemed. The Punjab crime was white-washed and
most culprits went not only unpunished but remained in service
and some continued to draw pensions from the Indian revenue, and
in some cases were rewarded. I saw too that not only did the reforms
not mark a change of heart, but they were only a method of
further draining India of her wealth and of prolonging her servitude.</p>

<p>I came reluctantly to the conclusion that the British connection
had made India more helpless than she ever was before, politically
and economically. A disarmed India has no power of resistance
against any aggressor if she wanted to engage in an armed conflict
with him. So much is this the case that some of our best men
consider that India must take generations before she can achieve
the Dominion status. She has become so poor that she has little
power of resisting famines. Before the British advent India spun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
and wove in her millions of cottages just the supplement she needed
for adding to her meagre agricultural resources. The cottage
industry, so vital for India's existence, has been ruined by incredibly
heartless and inhuman processes as described by English
witnesses. Little do town-dwellers know how the semi-starved
masses of Indians are slowly sinking to lifelessness. Little
do they know that their miserable comfort represents the
brokerage they get for the work they do for the foreign
exploiter, that the profits and the brokerage are sucked from the
masses. Little do they realise that the Government established
by law in British India is carried on for this exploitation of the
masses. No sophistry, no jugglery in figures can explain away the
evidence the skeletons in many villages present to the naked eye. I
have no doubt whatsoever that both England and the town-dwellers
of India will have to answer, if there is a God above, for this
crime against humanity which is perhaps unequalled in history.
The law itself in this country has been used to serve the foreign
exploiter. My unbiased examination of the Punjab Martial Law
cases has led me to believe that at least ninety-five per cent of convictions
were wholly bad. My experience of political cases in
India leads me to the conclusion that in nine out of every ten the
condemned men were totally innocent. Their crime consisted in
love of their country. In ninety-nine cases out of hundred justice
has been denied to Indians as against Europeans in the Court of
India. This is not an exaggerated picture. It is the experience of
almost every Indian who has had anything to do with such cases.
In my opinion the administration of the law is thus prostituted consciously
or unconsciously for the benefit of the exploiter.</p>

<p>The greatest misfortune is that Englishmen and their Indian
associates in the administration of the country do not know that
they are engaged in the crime I have attempted to describe. I am
satisfied that many English and Indian officials honestly believe
that they are administering one of the best systems devised in the
world and that India is making steady though slow progress. They
do not know that a subtle but effective system of terrorism and an
organised display of force on the one hand and the deprivation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
all powers of retaliation or self-defence on the other have emasculated
the people and induced in them the habit of simulation. This
awful habit has added to the ignorance and the self-deception of
the administrators. Section 124-A under which I am happily
charged is perhaps the prince among the political sections of the
Indian Penal Code designed to suppress the liberty of the
citizen. Affection cannot be manufactured or regulated by
law. If one has no affection for a person or thing one should
be free to give the fullest expression to his disaffection so
long as he does not contemplate, promote or incite to violence.
But the section under which Mr. Banker and I are
charged is one under which mere promotion of disaffection is a
crime. I have studied some of the cases tried under it, and I know
that some of the most loved of India's patriots have been convicted
under it. I consider it a privilege therefore, to be charged
under it. I have endeavoured to give in their briefest outline the
reasons for my disaffection. I have no personal ill-will against any
single administrator, much less can I have any disaffection towards
the King's person. But I hold it to be a virtue to be disaffected
towards a Government which in its totality has done more harm
to India than any previous system. India is less manly under the
British rule than she ever was before. Holding such a belief, I
consider it to be a sin to have affection for the system. And it
has been a precious privilege for me to be able to write what I
have in the various articles tendered in evidence against me.</p>

<p>In fact I believe that I have rendered a service to India and
England by showing in non-co-operation the way out of the
unnatural state in which both are living. In my humble opinion,
non-co-operation with evil is as much a duty as is co-operation
with good. But in the past, non-co-operation has been deliberately
expressed in violence to the evildoer. I am endeavouring to
show to my countrymen that violent non-co-operation only
multiplies evil and that as evil can only be sustained by violence,
withdrawal of support of evil requires complete abstention from
violence. Non-violence implies voluntary submission to the
penalty for non-co-operation with evil. I am here, therefore, to
invite and submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be
inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what
appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen. The only
course open to you, the Judge and the Assessors, is either to
resign your posts and thus dissociate yourselves from evil if
you feel that the law you are called upon to administer
is an evil and that in reality I am innocent, or to inflict on me the
severest penalty if you believe that the system and the law you are
assisting to administer are good for the people of this country
and that my activity is therefore injurious to the public weal.</p>

 serious, had to resort to firing. On arrival of more police, the crowd

<h2>APPENDIX XXIII<br />
    The Honourable Sir William Vincent's Speech at
    the Legislative Assembly, 18th January 1922</h2>

<p>I say, Sir, from that time we have always avoided
systematically and steadily any excessive severity <i>vis a vis</i> this
movement. Later, there were a number of seditious speeches,
including incitements to violence, particularly by Mr. Muhammad
Ali and his brother, and Government were prepared to take action
against them. What ensued is well known to the Members of
this Assembly. There were meetings between Mr. Gandhi and
His Excellency, and later Muhammad Ali and his brother offered
to the public certain undertakings on which the Government
withdrew the prosecutions against them. In a letter of June, 1921,
addressed to Local Governments after this undertaking we indeed
expressed some hope that it might be possible to reduce the
number of prosecutions. We were anxious not to force the pace
and although we always maintained our determination to keep
order, we sought to avoid over-drastic action against the less
dangerous or less violent adherents of the movement. At the
same time we indicated to Local Governments that they were
not to prosecute persons, the prosecution of whom might have
great effect outside the province, without consulting the Government
of India. In that letter, further, we invited Local Governments
to give certain other convicted persons the same <i>locus
poenitentiae</i> which had been given to Muhammad Ali and his
brother. We have throughout avoided very carefully any
suggestion, any action which might create the impression that
we desire to interfere with a legitimate political movement. I
defy any Member of this Assembly to say otherwise. We
have indeed frequently been reproached with weakness on this
account. I maintain that it was not weakness but patience.
At the same time, we made every effort to meet the legitimate
wishes of educated opinion in this country. I have no time to-day to
recapitulate all we have done but I should like to mention such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
matters as the compensation to persons injured in the Punjab
disorders, the further review of the Punjab sentences, the Committee
on the Press Act, the results of which will be before this
Assembly very shortly; again, the Committee on repressive measures
and the Committee to inquire into racial distinctions in
criminal proceedings. In fact, there was no question that came
before us in which we did not honestly seek to meet moderate
Members of the Assembly in order to consolidate the moderate
party into a great working power in the country for good. What has
been response of Mr. Gandhi and his followers? I maintain that
it has been one steady stream of sedition, one steady attempt to
subvert Government, one method of promoting this object being
adopted after another. Sometimes it has been the boycott of piece goods
in order to injure British trade, although Mr. Gandhi had
himself I believe, at one time said that 'boycott' was a word that
was entirely inconsistent with his principle of 'Ahimsa'. Later
this movement took the form of attempts on the loyalty of our
troops attempts on the police and there were constant incitements
to disorder. These have resulted in serious outbreaks of violence
in many parts of the country, the most important of which was the
Moplah outbreak. Sir, there has recently been some attempt to
minimise the cruelties committed by the Moplahs in Malabar. I
refer in particular to the remarks of Mr. Abdul Bari and Mr.
Husrat Mohani on this subject. Mr. Abdul Bari spoke of the pure
spirit of the Moplahs and denied the veracity of the accounts of
their atrocities. Mr. Husrat Mohani justifies them in the following
words:</p>

<p>"At such a critical juncture when they are engaged in
war against the English, their Hindu neighbours not only
do not help them or observe neutrality but aid and assist the
English in every possible way. They can indeed contend that,
while they are fighting a defensive war for the sake of their religion
and have left their houses, property and belongings, and taken refuge
in the hills and jungles, it is unfair to characterise as plunder
their commandeering of money, provisions and other necessities
for their troops from the English and their supporters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
Many of us, however, have, I believe, some knowledge of the
atrocities committed by these men, atrocities which I am certain
in my mind that every Mussalman in this House deplores as deeply
as I do, and they will appreciate what a misrepresentation of the
facts this is. The barbarities of the Moplahs have been indefensible.
I will cite one instance '<i>New India</i>' in support of what I
say. Writing of a respectable Nair, an article in this paper states:</p>

<p>'When on the 26th he threatened other steps, the rebels forced
their way into his house, dragged him out, along with his wife and
two children carried them to the mosque and bathed all four and
compelled them to recite verses from the Koran and dress as
Moplahs. At mid-night they were led home and imprisoned.
Next day the deponent's head was shaved and ten days later a certain
notorious criminal (now in custody) forcibly circumcised the
deponent. Three weeks later he and his family and other converts
(some being Christians) escaped to Shoranur.'</p>

<p>Sir, I am one of those who have been to Malabar, I have seen
myself refugees, a thousand in one refuge, hungry, homeless, lacking
clothes, and I can assure Members of this Assembly that it
was a pitiable sight to see. I only mention the facts because
this attempt has been made and because this rising, these
acts of cruelty and murder are one of the direct results
of the Khilafat movement. I do not put it (I never have put
it) that Mr. Gandhi is responsible for this directly, but I do
say that his supporters&mdash;his Muhammadan supporters&mdash;were the
cause of this terrible loss of life. Indeed you have only got to
read, Mr. Hasrat Mohani's speech to see what the character of
the rising was. Now, if the Moplah outbreak had been an isolated
instance of disorder, as I said in the last Session, the Government
might not have been forced to take action against this non-co-operation
movement. It might well have been argued that the
circumstances were exceptional. But have Members of this
Assembly read the report which is attached to the Repressive
Measures Committee? Have they read the appendix setting out a
list of 34 outbreaks of disorders of a serious character within a
year? Sir, we have been told that after the declaration of policy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
by this Government in March last, the non-co-operation movement
was dying down. I think that I am correct in making this statement;
and I hope I am not misrepresenting anybody. Is there any
foundation for it? Does not every Member of this Assembly know
that that is absolutely inaccurate? Does not every Member here
know that the movement of disloyalty to the Crown, intended to
paralyse Government, intended to subvert the administration, has
been growing day by day throughout the year? Can any man here
say that actually the movement was losing strength? Do not these
disorders tell a different story&mdash;these outbreaks which culminated
in the riots in Bombay on the 17th November? Before I come to
that however, I want to deal with another point. May I inform
this Assembly that, during the present year, it has been necessary
to call out the military to suppress serious disorder no less than
47 times? May I tell them that, during the last three months,
military assistance has had to be invoked&mdash;I have here the figures
from His Excellency the Commander in-Chief&mdash;no less than 19
times? Does that look as if the forces of disorder were losing
strength before the Government took this action?</p>

<p>And now, Sir, I want to turn to the rioting in Bombay in
which the lawless tendencies of those who follow Mr. Gandhi&mdash;not
of Mr. Gandhi himself&mdash;culminated. Bombay is a city in which
Mr. Gandhi is supposed to exercise the greatest influence. He
himself was present there on the 17th November. The occasion
was one, one would have thought, when at least every loyal citizen
of the Crown, whatever his political views, would have avoided
any disorder or riot. It was the occasion of the landing of His
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, the heir to the Throne of
England. That was the occasion chosen by the non-co-operators
in Bombay for an outbreak of violence which, I believe, has not
been paralleled in that city for many many years, and what was
the object of those who embarked upon this campaign of violence?
I say the object was vengeance, vengeance on those who dared
to go forth to welcome His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales
in spite of Mr. Gandhi's direction&mdash;that was the sole crime of the
unfortunate people so maltreated. That Sir, is the result of non-violent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
non-co-operation. Was Mr. Gandhi able to exercise any
influence to stop the demand? Why, it was pathetic to read his
words next day. He was full of sorrow, but he had not thought
of the consequences of his act before. After all he had
warning on previous occasions. Well, Sir, I do not know
that I need go through the events of these terrible days.
You have heard from my Honourable friend, Mr. Dwaraka
Das, how women were assaulted in the public streets; you
have read in the papers how harmless Europeans and Indians,
including many Parsis, were murdered, or assaulted, how
one unfortunate engine driver, going home from his work, a harmless
individual, was suddenly attacked and murdered by a cruel
mob. All this was the result of this non-violent movement. The
reports say that it began in intimidation and that was not checked,
those who had been guilty of intimidation thought they could
proceed with impunity to violence. The damage done to property
also&mdash;the property of private individuals&mdash;was very great. I read
in one report, of 137 shops being looted and that is an under statement
of all the damage.</p>

<p>Now, let us see what was happening in other places on that
day? In Delhi there was <i>hartal</i> enforced by systematic threats
and intimidation. And I assert here, and I dare any one to
contradict me, that intimidation was practised by men posing as
volunteers; men dressed as volunteers who paraded the streets
and interfered with the liberty of law-abiding citizens in a manner
that is intolerable in any civilised community. Is it surprising that
we received many complaints actually of absolute want of any
Government control at the time? In Calcutta, again there was
<i>hartal</i> promoted by general intimidation and violence on the part
of volunteers. It is idle for any one to deny it. Mr. Abdul Kasem
and other Members were in Calcutta and they know the facts. The
Government of Bengal, writing on the 26th November, reported
that an incessant stream of seditious speeches was being poured
forth, that money was being freely spent in the employment of
paid agents; and here I may tell the Assembly that many of these
volunteers,&mdash;I do not say all of them because that would be wrong,&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
many of these volunteers are merely paid men, paid a rupee
a day, and, in fact when the supply of money dries up,&mdash;and there
have been places where this has happened,&mdash;the supply of volunteers
has run short. We were also told by the Bengal Government
that on the 17th there was general suspension of activities of
all kinds and the riff-raff of the city, under the guise of volunteers,
was abroad, terrorising and abusing law-abiding folk, and there
were numerous instances of molestations of Europeans and
Indians. The authority of Government was openly flouted; and
law abiding citizens were depressed because of Government's
failure to protect them, I have got instances here of the different
kinds of speeches made in Bengal. I do not think I need cite
them except to mention that one of them says:</p>

<p>'That the Bengalees had discovered the death-arrow of the
English. Remember Kanai and Khudiram Bose and others of
Bengal.'</p>

<p>I do not suppose the Members of this Assembly know who
they were; they were prominent murderers; some, if not all of
them, were hanged. Well, Sir, the whole effect of the activities
was that, on the 17th of November in Calcutta there was an
absolute effacement of the authority of Government, and general
intimidation throughout the whole of the city. I am told now
that we exaggerated all this: There was a <i>hartal</i>, it is true, but
there was nothing more than a voluntary one. Well, the <i>Amrita
Bazar Patrika</i>, itself stated on the morning of the 18th a most
significant fact&mdash;I cite it because it is testimony coming from an
adversary&mdash;it said on the 18th 'Writ large on the <i>hartal</i> of
Calcutta is revolution'. Now I ask the Assembly to ponder those
words.</p>

<p>I may say that throughout all this period the most
desperate efforts were made to create racial animosity.
Those who were in Calcutta in December last&mdash;I was there&mdash;know
how true this is and it was a very dangerous factor
in the situation. There was also at that time every reason to
believe that if the activities of these so-called volunteers were not
curtailed, we should have a repetition in Calcutta of what we had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
in Bombay. Now the total deaths in Bombay were 53 people
killed, and I think something like 400 injured went to the Hospital.
The problem before the Government, therefore, was: are you
going to sit quietly, or, as my Honourable friend said, 'with folded
hands' and watch with apathy and inertia this slaughter of innocent
people, or are you going to take action while there is yet time?
The Assembly remember also that previously, on the 14th of
November, there had been already a dangerous riot in Calcutta at
Belgatchia, in which over 5,000 people had been engaged. Now, I
maintain that, in such circumstances, the Bengal Government
were fully justified in taking the action. We have abundant
testimony that, whatever be the professions of those who inaugurate
these volunteer movement, their practice and precept are poles
apart. You may say that they enter into a solemn vow of non-violence,
but in practice they are repeatedly constantly and
persistently, guilty of intimidation and violence. Let me turn to
another province. I have got a report here from the Bihar
Government. We called for these reports to see on what grounds
they had proceeded against these associations. The replies show
that Local Governments were satisfied that the members of the
proscribed associations went in systematically for this class of
offence. To return to Bihar, on the 10th of December, I received
a report from the Local Government which says that these
volunteers had been guilty of intimidation, violence and other forms
of criminal action on no less than 122 occasions reported in the
last year. One of the incidents is worthy of special mention,
indeed many of them are. The one to which I refer was the case
of a poor Muhammadan who had the misfortune to be a law-abiding
subject of the Crown. He died in Ranchi and his funeral
had to be performed. But the non-co-operators said: "No, he
shall not be buried by Muhammadans." Well, some over-daruni
spirit said: 'Oh, his was not so great an offence that we should
allow this oppression; men who differ from other in their political
views are entitled to a little toleration.' So they took the body to
the graveyard with police protection and buried it. What was the next
action of the extremists? The non-co-operation volunteers dug up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
the corpse and dishonoured it, ('Shame.') Well that is the conduct
of these non-violent non-co-operation volunteers. Again, on the
17th in Calcutta, there were unfortunately two Muhammadans
who died in Ballygunge of natural causes and those who wished to
bury them could not procure the necessary assistance: they were
unable to procure bearers or <i>Khatias</i> or anything else and the
bodies remained unburied for the whole of that day. There was
many a sick man and woman in Calcutta on the 17th who could
not procure medical attendance. No conveyances for medical
practitioners, and when doctors walked to the patients and attended
on them, they would not get medicine, because the dispensaries
were not allowed under the strict orders of the non-co-operators to
sell medicine even to save life on that day. Now, is that intimidation
or is it not? I have been told that Government interferes with
the liberty of the subject in proscribing these associations. I am
amazed at the audacity of those who make such an accusation,
whether it comes from the Members of this Assembly or from
those who are of different political opinions, and I include Mr.
Gandhi. Who in reality has interfered with the liberty of the subject
to the same extent as members of his party? Who is it that will
not allow those who wish to welcome the Prince to do so? Who
prevents reasonable respect being shown to the dead! Who boycots
and intimidates those who venture to serve the Crown or
wish to sell or buy foreign piece goods? Who will not allow any
member of the Assembly to address a public meeting without
interruption? ('Hear, hear'.) Who, then, is it that is really
guilty of interference with the liberty of the subject? What
extremist can make, with justice, this accusation against the Government?
What has the Government done in this matter?...</p>

<p>And now, Sir, I wish to turn to our instructions of 24th November,
in so far as the Criminal Law Amendment Act goes. They
were to the effect that where associations practised intimidation
violence and obstruction, it was necessary to suppress those activities
and that the Act of 1908 should be used for that purpose. I
believe, up to a certain point at any rate, it has been successful.
What followed? A number of young men&mdash;many of them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
Calcutta, hired from the mills&mdash;joined these associations as
volunteers for a money reward. Many are doing it in Delhi now
and a rupee a day is the price. They join the volunteers in defiance
of all orders and then complain bitterly and pose as patriots,
if they are arrested. In Delhi, when the movement first started
and arrests took place, the authorities were anxious not to impose
too severe penalties on accused and the consequence was, they
were sentenced simple imprisonment. Many of them were quite
pleased; they were able to get free meals and had nothing to do,
so later it was found necessary to sentence others to rigorous
imprisonment. At once there was a general feeling that this was
very unfair, though it was really a very natural consequence.
Throughout, however, the Government have been very anxious to
avoid any appearance of undue severity; to avoid any appearance
of unreasonable harshness we have made various suggestions to
the Local Governments with which I will deal later. Apart
from this, however, His Excellency was never unmindful of the
dangers of a purely regressive policy and, as every Honourable
Member knows he received a deputation on the 21st December in
Calcutta and listened to their views on the action of Government
and the possibility of a conference between different sections of
the community and Government. And I should like to read to
Honourable Members one or two words from His Excellency's
reply to that deputation because, to my mind, his words breathe a
lofty tone of statesmanship and indicate a deep desire to find a
solution of the problem of all the difficulties with which the Government
are faced. He spoke words over which every Member of
this Assembly would do well to ponder. Referring to a suggestion
that Government should cease making use of measures now
enforced and release prisoners convicted under the law, he said:</p>

<p>'I cannot believe that this was the intention, of the deputation,
when originally suggested, for it would mean that throughout
the country intimidation and unlawful oppression and other unlawful
acts should be allowed to continue, whilst Government action to
maintain order and protect the law-abiding citizen would be largely
paralysed. I need scarcely tell you that no responsible Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
could even contemplate the acceptance of such a state of
public affairs. I wish with all my heart, that it had been possible to
deal with these problems in a large and generous spirit, worthy of
such on occasion in the history of India. Had there been indications
to this effect before me to-day in the representations which you
have made in your address on the part of the leaders of non-co-operation,
had the offer been made to discontinue open breaches
of the law for the purpose of providing a calmer atmosphere for
discussion of remedies suggested, my Government would never have
been backward in response. We would have been prepared to
consider the new situation in the same large and generous spirit I
would have conferred with Local Governments for this purpose.'</p>

<p>Sir, now what was Mr. Gandhi's reply to this? This is what
Mr. Gandhi said:</p>

<p>'I am sorry that I suspect Lord Reading of complicity in the
plot to unman India.'</p>

<p>I would ask Honourable Members of this Assembly if they
would take that view. He proceeded to say:</p>

<p>"I am forced to conclude that Lord Reading is trying to
emasculate India by forcibly making free speech and popular
organization impossible."</p>

<p>In another article he said:</p>

<p>"I was totally unprepared for what I most respectfully call
his mischievous misrepresentation of the attitude of the Congress
and the Khilafat organisations in connection with the visit of His
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales."</p>

<p>This country is, in truth, faced with a very grave crisis:
we have civil disobedience looming before us. We have threats
of organised violence from an influential section of the Mussalman
population. We have had outbreaks of violence of a dangerous
character showing what may happen in a more extended degree
in future. We have had the most terrible bloodshed and loss
of life. We are face to face with a situation in which there may
be, I fear, greater loss of life and greater bloodshed. It is for the
Assembly to say whether they are now going to encourage the
forces which make for ruin and disorder. It is for them to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
whether, consistently with their oath of allegiance to the Crown,
most solemnly sworn here, they can conscientiously and deliberately
encourage those who intend to overthrow this Government by
any means that is possible. Lastly, it is for them to ponder their
responsibility not only to the Assembly, not only to the Government
and to the country, but also to themselves. It is for them
to say whether they will take such a course as will facilitate a real
and very grave danger to their own properties, to their own lives,
to their own honour.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
